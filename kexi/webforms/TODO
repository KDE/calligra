Hey Emacs, this is an -*- org -*- file!

TODO list for Kexi Web Forms:
This file is maintained using Emacs' org-mode please do not edit it
by hand and use org-mode instead.


* Basic kwebforms implementation

   - [ ] Implement CREATE
   - [X] Implement READ
   - [X] Implement UPDATE
   - [X] Implement DELETE
   - [ ] Implement shortcut and connection file loading
*** TODO Refine code


** Add a 'RUN SQL Query' box [0%]
   1. [ ] Discuss the security policy model with Jaroslaw
      - In particular :: which type of queries allow/deny (we don't want to allow
      anybody to truncate tables)
   2. [ ] Discuss the implementation model with Jaroslaw
      - [ ] Discuss a possible authentication system. Maybe use HTTP auth
      - [ ] Implement the authentication system

   1. [ ] Recreate a new template from scratch, the current one is awful
      - Take inspiration from our competitors? :-)

* Post GSOC Tasks/Ideas
** TODO New webserver backend
   I'd like to see a new webserver backend. Using function pointers is not the
   best way to implement handlers.
   It should be most probably written using QtNetwork.
   It should be designed as a library, with multithreading support, to improve
   and encourage reuse.
