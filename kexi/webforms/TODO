Hey Emacs, this is an -*- org -*- file!

TODO list for Kexi Web Forms:
This file is maintained using Emacs' org-mode please do not edit it
by hand and use org-mode instead.


* Basic kwebforms implementation
** Implement basic CRUD Operations [80%]

   1. [ ] Discuss the security policy model with Jaroslaw
      - In particular :: which type of queries allow/deny (we don't want to allow

      - Take inspiration from our competitors? :-)

* Post GSOC Tasks/Ideas
** TODO New webserver backend
   I'd like to see a new webserver backend. Using function pointers is not the
   best way to implement handlers.
   It should be most probably written using QtNetwork.
   It should be designed as a library, with multithreading support, to improve
   and encourage reuse.

   - Ideally this can be made using QtNetwork and QThread classes to create a
   Pure C++ multithreaded web server. The webserver should be developed as a library
   to improve code reuse.
