4. Information for KexiDB drivers developers
--------------------------------------------

While you're developing new driver or improving existing one,
you may want to test a number of aspects to see if the behaviour 
looks like expected.

Following tests should be passed (the order is from most simple 
test to more complicated):

-dbcreation
-schema
-tables
-cursors
-tableview
-parser
-dr_prop

If the given driver does not pass one of these tests, and you have found:
- that the problem is at the KexiDB library side (e.g. crash, or improper
behaviour), or
- that the problem can be solved by extending KexiDB API, or
- that the documentation is not correct or not enough detailed, or
- whatever like that,
