TIP: For most important commits use: CCMAIL:kexi-devel@kde.org
TIP: For interesting commits use
FEATURE: <description>
CCMAIL:danny@commit-digest.org
TIP: For bugfixes use CCMAIL:###-done@bugs.kde.org
TIP: Use "QT_FLUSH_PAINT=10 kexi" (or "set QT_FLUSH_PAINT=10; kexi" on Windows) to debug painting.

TODO KoProperty:
- mising border below the last item when its editor is visible
- when started to change the editor's value:
-- "revert" button should appear
-- if the property has parent, the item for the parent should be repainted
- (??) fix or reimplement spin box widgets: look bad with oxygen and probably other styles
- fix setting font values: in form designer we need to leave and reenter the item to apply the changes
- SetPrivate::m_visiblePropertiesCount should be altered also when Property::setVisible() is called on added property

TODO:
- crash in keximainwindow...... create > script > select the interpreter property, and change it from python to qtscript
  http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/calligra/kexi/koproperty2/koproperty/EditorView.cpp?r1=883465&r2=910657&pathrev=910657
- (the same?) Create a database -> enter the table schema editor -> add a field -> try to change the field type -> crash
http://rafb.net/p/R4QIBR13.html
- general: use KPluginInfo for any kind of plugins, what would allow for creating main window
           (esp. the project navigator) without loading any plugins in advance
- use semantic API for any i18n string, e.g. i18n("Do you want to clear the contents of table %1?", tableName)

Forms TODO
TODO Form editor:
 - FormManager::FormManager: register factory (port to koproperty2)
 - port KFDPixmapEdit, PropertyFactory
 - add translation and simplify "textInteractionFlags" for QTextEdit and QLabel
 - clicking too many time on undo CRASHES
 - fix syncing form geometry with properties in the propeditor
 - show Spring element and autofield widget
 - disable 'assign action' when no button is selected
 - port 'assign action' dialog to QColumnView
 - disable mouse-over highlighting effect for buttons and check boxes
 
TODO: (Windows-only?) when right-clicking again after context menu has been displayed, update selection, otherwise the context menu items won't be adequate to the selection
 - setting alignment property (e.g. for text box) does not work because it is numeric now
TODO: clearing widget's dataSource property sets datasource to "" in XML instead of clrearing it completely; the same for form's dataSource and dataSourcePartClass properties

TODO: image box widgets: support transparency in clipboard (Windows)
TODO: image box widgets: changing aspect or scale properties should repaint the widget immediately
TODO: replace KexiDataItemChangesListener::handleAction(const QString& actionName) with signal/slot connections
TODO: wrap passwordMode property for line edit widget in design mode, otherwise data source is displayed using *
TODO: use KRichTextWidget or KRichTextEdit instead of KTextEdit
TODO: text editor: autofill disabled because this makes the widget disappear entirely; now fix the background color because it is getting transparent on mouse out in design mode
Main Window TODO

- fix positions of multiple widgets pasted from clipboard position:
  subtracting the original offset and adding the new one

2009-03-02
Forms
- show properties for form widgets (that was broken by mistake)
- we are sharing the same KoProperty::Set object so use propertySetReloaded() 
  instead of propertySetSwitched(), otherwise the property editor would 
  not refresh
TODO: use QObject's "objectName" property instead of nonexiting "name"

2009-03-01

2009-02-28
Forms
- do not align selection rectangle to grid

2009-02-27
Forms
= make the actions from widget-action-group accessible for the Form object

  inserting a new widget
TODO: remove usage of KFormDesigner::ActionGroup when the two libraries are merged

2009-02-26
Forms

2009-02-23
Forms
- optimized painting grid: only required rectangle is painted; 
  this makes moving or resizing widgets smoother
TODO: optimize more; there are 2 events when widget is moved
[5496] kexi(5496)/kexi (general) bool __thiscall KFormDesigner::Container::eventFilter(class QObject *,class QEvent *): QRect(457,367 41x35)

  on border should be enough for users to recognize boundary of the form

2009-02-20
Forms
- now at least empty form appears again
- context menu: avoid displaying it twice; fix crash

2009-01-12..2009-02-18
Forms
- Forms Refactoring
-First phase of Kexi Forms Module refactoring. The main reason is to
  simplify the codebase and prepare it to future enchancements like 
  subforms, reports integration, and tabbed main window design.
-Detailed reasons for refactoring:
--The process of instantiating a form (the Form class) is very 
   complicated now what makes it very hard to properly implement subforms
--The code full of interdependencies and thus is fragile when adding new
   functionality or fixing bugs
--The FormManager class centralizes a number of operations that shall 
   belong to Form itself
--The naming of methods and classes can be improved, 
   e.g. Form -> FormController
--The ObjectTree* classes introduce redundancy as we already have 
   QWidget hierarchy, and extensible property system; this complicates 
   the code
-Details:
-Form and FormManager:
--FormManager removed. Most facilities of FormManager merged into Form.
   Thus we are no longer track 'active form' on switching between forms;
   instead each Form object keeps necessary information.
--void FormManager::insertWidget(const QByteArray &classname) moved
--void FormManager::stopInsert() moved as abortWidgetInserting()
--void FormManager::enterConnectingState() moved as enterConnectingState()
--void FormManager::stopCreatingConnection() moved 
   as abortCreatingConnection()
--void FormManager::slotPointerClicked() moved
   as enterWidgetSelectingState()
--Form::State enum defined instead of multiple boolean attributes
   of FormManager
--FormManager::isInserting() and FormManager::isCreatingConnection()
   removed, Form::state() is used instead
--Design or View mode is expressed using Mode enum value, not boolean flag
--Form::setSelectedWidget(QWidget *w, bool add, bool dontRaise, 
   bool moreWillBeSelected) replaced with 
   Form::selectWidget(QWidget *w, Form::WidgetSelectionFlags)
--Form::deSelectWidget(QWidget*) replaced with 
   Form::deselectWidget(QWidget*)
--bool FormManager::isTopLevel(QWidget*) moved
   to Form::isTopLevelWidget(QWidget*)
--FormManager::selectedClass() removed
--WidgetLibrary* FormManager::createWidgetLibrary(FormManager* m, const 
   QStringList& supportedFactoryGroups) removed, WidgetLibrary 
   is instantiated directly by KexiFormPart
--FormManager::dirty(KFormDesigner::Form *form, bool isDirty = true) 
   signal moved to Form::modified() signal
--FormManager::showFormUICode() moved to KexiFormManager
--FormManager::m_emitSelectionSignalsUpdatesPropertySet removed since 
   we're not using windowChanged() (??)
--void FormManager::setObjectTreeView(ObjectTreeView *treeview) 
   moved to KexiFormManager::init()
-WidgetPropertySet
--removed, its code moved to Form
--emitWidgetPropertyChanged() removed
-Added #ifdef KFD_SIGSLOTS to disable code related to visual handling 
  signal/slots connection
-FormWidget
--code moved to FormWidget.h and FormWidget.cpp
--clearForm() removed (let's hopw QWidget update() is enough)
-Commands:
--Paste/Cut/Copy commands use QApplication::clipboard() now instead 
  of FormManager::self()->m_domDoc, which has been removed
-Container:
--void setSelectedWidget(QWidget *selected, bool add, 
   bool dontRaise = false, bool moreWillBeSelected = false) 
   -> selectWidget(QWidget *w, Form::WidgetSelectionFlags flags 
   = Form::DefaultWidgetSelectionFlags)
--LayoutType enum moved to Form
--setLayout() -> setLayoutType()
-KexiFormPart
--slotPropertyChanged() moved to Form::handleWidgetPropertyChanged(),
   so Form::widgetPropertyChanged() signal can be now removed
--slotAutoTabStopsSet()'s code moved to Form::editTabOrder() itself
--KexiFormPart::static_formsLibrary moved to KexiFormManger
--slotWidgetCreatedByFormsLibrary(QWidget*) moved to KexiFormManger
--WidgetLibrary* KexiFormPart::library() moved to KexiFormManager
--assignAction() moved to KexiFormManager
-KexiFormManger
--added static self()
--is initialized by KexiFormPart

- ported Kexi*Formatter classes, reenabled their use in KexiTableView and forms;
  this fixes entering of the first character in table view cells

2008-12-07
Table View
- delay the 1st call to 'ensure cell visible' routine to avoid invalid 
  vertical scroll position on table view creation

2008-12-04
Widgets
- set "word wrap" by default in kexi editors (e.g. used in the SQL editor)

TODO: any idea how to use KTextEditor::Document::setText() without touching 
      the undo buffer? For now we're allowing user to execute "undo" action
      what just clears the editor's contents.

2008-12-03
Kexi
= added more detailed debug areas for Kexi: 
    44019        kexi (main)
    44021        kexi (plugins)
    44022        kexi (property)

  (used e.g. in the Query Designer)

2008-11-21
Core
- make default value of X-Kexi-PropertyEditorAlwaysVisibleInDesignMode 
  flag for kexi parts == true by default
- remove crash on creation of a new part item that is first of its class 
  within a given project; e.g. when the first query is created
  (introduced after moving towards "part classes")

2008-11-19
Main Window
- property editor pane now is displayed when user clicks "new table"
  action (there's no property set yet, but we want to display the pane 
  in advance)
Table View
- fixed crash on mouse move in "what's this mode" over the table view:
  when "column under mouse" is -1
- clicking vertical header changes current row
- mouse move over vertival header updates table view row highlighting

2008-11-18
Table View
- fixed the table view's vertical header paint routine;
  moreover, the icons are now displayed using the current 
  foreground color

2008-11-16
Widgets
= vertical header: use brush instead of just color, 
  and paint the background prior to using QStyle
  (this still isn't proper fix)

2008-11-15
Kexi
= ported uses of setPaletteBackgroundColor() 
  and setPaletteForegroundColor() to Qt 4

2008-11-14
Tables
- fixed bug in table removing code, introduced in r671303
Core
- in general: we're no longer using part IDs, we have switched 
  to Java-like part class names e.g. org.kexi-project.table;
  this allows for easier development of custom 3rdparty plugins
- Plugins: removed X-Kexi-TypeMime property (of values like kexi/query)
  and added X-Kexi-Class, e.g. org.kexi-project.query
- KexiPart::Manager::partForMimeType() replaced 
  by KexiPart::Manager::partForClass()

  by to KexiPart::Manager::infoForClass()
- KexiProject::itemsForMimeType() replaced
  by KexiProject::itemsForClass()

- added overloaded ctor of Set::Iterator accepting functor
- removed unnecessary koproperty{warn|dbg} macros 
  as we use own KDE_DEFAULT_DEBUG_AREA
- added Set::PropertySelector for easy iterating over selected properties
- Set is now based on QHash<QByteArray, Property*>
- Set::Iterator is now based on QHash<QByteArray, Property*>::ConstIterator,
  not on an ascii dict iterator from Qt3. 
- optimized removing properties from the set and thus destructing sets

2008-11-08
Kexi
- use KoProperty2 in Kexi (this breaks many functions now)
KexiDB
- MySQL driver: fixed problem with creating a new database 
  when the name contains uppercase characters
  (MySQL's "SHOW DATABASES LIKE .." does not work unless 
  we convert the argument to lowecase.
= make a few statements uppercase
- use QString::arg() and escapeIdentifier() for building 
  statements (security..)
Predicate: ported

- improvements in the model and view classes

2008-09-23
KoProperty2
- 'revert to defaults' works
- line edit now uses KLineEdit and has clear button enabled
- added tooltip for 'revert to defaults' button

2008-09-11..21
KoProperty2
--EditorDataModel: use buddy() so we can show editor widget even when 1st column's cell was clicked
--EditorView: test StringEdit editor and a test factory created
--ItemDelegate: paint full-line borders, like in Designer and many other propeditors (there's no way 
to paint [+] without branch lines in Qt4's QStyle anyway); 
- modified properties are displayed in bold
- 'revert to defaults' button reintroduced
- parts of Editor class API ported to EditorView

2008-09-10

- a single record is no longer limited to one page
  CCBUG:150167
CSV Import Dialog
(ported from 1.3, implemented on 2008-05-27)
- added support for boolean (1, 0, yes, no, true, false) and floating-point data types
- fixed all dates after 2000 appearing after import wrongly as being 
  of the 20th century i.e. 1901 or 1902 instead of 2001 or 2002;
  to implement this, added config value MinimumYearFor100YearSlidingWindow, 
  by default 1930, range of years that defines where any year expressed as two digits falls. 
  For date window from 1930 to 2029, two-digit years between 0 and 29 fall in the 2000s, 
  and two-digit years between 30 and 99 fall in the 1900s. 
CCBUG:151478

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 2.0 alpha 9 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSV Import Dialog
- fix setting data types for columns, previously text type was used instead
- fix autodetecting and importing of floating-point values in "E scientific notation"
- output null values to fields if value coversion failed (e.g. text-to-date);
  without this subsequent values are written into the wrong columns
- added "Date format" import option with possible values: auto, DMY, YMD, MDY

- execute 'copy to clipboard' instead of 'copy to file' in 'edit->copy special' menu
1.x: merged

2008-01-17
Table View
- A fix for data editing bug #155899. 
  When a default value is specified for an field with 'required' flag,
  it was not only applied when a new row is created,
  but also when an existing row is edited,
  thus overwriting the existing value.

2008-01-10
KexiDB
- Fix the bug #146818: handling expressions containing
 binary operators like *, /, -, + where both arguments are of
 floating-point type (with single or double precision).
 Previously the result was marked as boolean, now it is
 floating-point.

2007-12-09

2005-11-02..04
2005-10-31
Project Migration
- call KexiProject is used to create destination database instead of KexiDB::Connection
  because tables like kexi__parts and kexi__blobs have to be created.
- Moving kexi projects from database servers to database files works.
  kexi__objects table contents are properly copied if existed in source database,
  so queries, forms etc. are properly imported
- Wizard's GUI improvements
KexiDB
- More verbose error messages: 
  Error messages and result numbers can be now inherited by using
  Object::setError( KexiDB::Object *obj, const QString& prependMessage ),

  "t1.id > 100" is used instead of "id > 100" in queries like
  SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id AND t1.id > 100
- fixed possible crash when invalid query design is loaded in design view
- fixed switching to design mode after invalid query was opened directly in text mode 
- eat parentheses on criteria loading, in WHERE conditions like (a.id = value)

  on failure, we're also asking parent widget factory for this, if one exists

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 0.8 beta 1 (with Calligra 1.4) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2005-04-27
Form Designer
- KexiGradientWidget ifdef'd out for 0.1 release 
  (using KEXI_USE_GRADIENT_WIDGET macro) due to problems with performance 
  and child widget's palettes
- added possibility of forcing particular class to be hidden 
  (eg. because it's not ready to use yet or makes no sense in current context)

2005-04-01..04
* Many improvements added for Kexi Forms, 
  including editable query results. *
KexiDB
- BIC CHANGE:
-- FieldList: field(const QString&) added
-- QuerySchema: field(const QString&) added; 
   insertField() and fieldsExpanded() improved;  
- documentation improved
Forms
- setting (predefined) queries as form's dataSource works
- editing data for _editable_ queries works (but not rows adding or removing)
- setting "tablename.fieldname" for data-aware widget's dataSource works
- setting "queryname.fieldname" for data-aware widget's dataSource works
- when a table is set as form's data source, all primary key's fields 
  are always fetched (so editing works well with autonumbers)
- autoSync set to false for dataSource properties (using KexiDataAwareWidgetInfo)
- improved support for invalid dataSource property
- data-aware widgets with invalid dataSource property are now removed from tab-focus cycle
  (setInvalidState() now implies setting ClickFocus flag)
- on form opening: first data-aware widget with TabFocus is focused (if available)
- void KexiFormDataProvider::fillDuplicatedDataItems() works well 
  also if there are data sources like "tablename.fieldname"
Forms Library
- autoSync flag can be overriden independently within every widget factory 
  for every single class, using WidgetInfo::setAutoSyncForProperty()
- when deselecting a widget with autoSync set to false property value is now set properly
Main
- KexiBrowser: pressing Enter key to accept item renaming won't execute "open" action


2005-03-30
Forms
- setting form's background color property fixed
KexiDB
- BIC CHANGE: a few dtors made virtual
- Connection: data inserting/updating/deleting:
-- more error messages and codes added
-- we're checking if master table's primary key is available
- QuerySchema: pkeyFieldsOrder() improved, pkeyFieldsCount() added.
- FieldList::indexOf() added

2005-03-29
Main Window
- dock windows' width is managed for TabPageMode in the same way as for ChildframeMode
- hiding property editor's dock when not needed
Table/Form Views
- database cursor deleted when not needed
Forms
- writing data changes implemented

2005-03-25
Forms
- "cancel cell editing" and "cancel row editing" implemented

2005-03-10..24
Forms, TableViews
- APIs for Forms and TableViews more integrated: 
-- KexiTableEdit now inherits KexiDataItemInterface
-- KexiDataItemInterface is now used in KexiDataAwareObjectInterface, 
   not KexiTableEdit
-- KexiFormScrollView and KexiDBForm now uses KexiDataAwareObjectInterface API
   for dealing with r/w data
- data-aware widgets with duplicated data source are updated concurently 
  on editing one of them
- within forms, "column" term is now related not to column within data model,
  but to order of data-aware widget. This "column" value is translated to
  column number within data model when needed. This allows to duplicate data 
  widgets, hide them, change their ordering, etc. For example, tab order 
  (and visual order) of data-aware widgets is independant of column ordering 
  within data model.
KexiDB
- BIC CHANGE: QuerySchema::parentTable() renamed to masterTable()
- QuerySchema::masterTable() now tries to return a table 
  if there's only one defined
- Connection::createTable() - on error, existing table schema object 
  is not destroyed (i.e. it is still available e.g. 
  using within Connection::tableSchema(const QString& ), 
  even if the table was physically dropped. 
  This fixes crash for "alter table dialog" when recreating table failed
  (the dialog expects that old table schema won't be destroyed).
- Connection::resultExists() avoid appending optimizing "LIMIT 1" suffix when
  the query statement is not "SELECT".
- Connection::createTableStatement(): length parameter is now only used 
  for text and not long text field types.
Alter Table Dialog
- changing subType to LongText hides "length" property;
  changing subType to Text shows "length" property. 

2005-03-04

2005-02-27
KexiDB
- mysql/sqlite drivers: fixed problem with xxxxConnection::value(int)
  when we're using raw sql statements (so expanded field list is empty)
- MySQL Driver: a hack to enable local connections without using 
  a local socket file: if user doesn't want to use local socket file,
  host name is automatically set (internally) to "127.0.0.1" 
  before connecting. This is especially usable when we're using SSH tunneling.

2005-02-26
Widgets
- KexiTableRM moved to KexiRecordMarker in libguiutils

- TabOrder dialog: "dirty" flag is always set to the curent form when the dialog is accepted
KexiDB
- Connection::dropTable(): be sure that we handle the correct TableSchema object
- Connection::storeObjectSchemaData() if we already have stored a schema data 
  with the same name and type - just update it's properties as it would be existing object

KexiRecordMarker
2005-02-23..25
Forms
- fixed Tab/BackTab ordering within form's fields, including cycles 
  and problems after detaching/attaching windows for Child Frame Mode.
  QApplication::sendEvent() used instead setFocus() for more realistic 
  (especially for QLineEdits) focusing effects when tabulator is pressed.
- QLabel and KexiPixmapLabel available again in KFD
Main

	if this is true, d->pEditor is NULL. So we're checking
	d->pEditor and calling startEditCurrentCell() only if it's present
- Empty row is appended on row deletion when 'spreadsheet mode' is on.
- fixed setting row numbers in record navigator for empty data sets
- fixed editing large FP numbers (removed scientific mode)

- Appearance class introduced: defines table view's detailed appearance settings
- "row highlighting" option added, comboboxpopup uses it
- fixed doubled empty row inserting (edit_insert_empty_row action)
- ensureCellVisible() fixed when record navigator is hidden
- many improvements in combo box editor and popup

-- now takes full width, painting fixed
-- update width when number of digits in rows counter changes
Main
- preferences and configureToolbars actions ifdefed using KEXI_SHOW_UNIMPLEMENTED
Plugins
- Default implementation of Part::remove() added again. 
  This is enough eg. for Form plugin.
- table and query plugin: Connection::eemoveObject() is called even 
  if object's could not be loaded, what allows to remove invalid objects.

2004-10-22
TableView
- KexiDateTimeTableEdit, KexiTimeTableEdit implemented
Table Designer
- BLOB types ifdefed using KEXI_SHOW_UNIMPLEMENTED
KexiDB
- DriverManager does not list derver-based projects 
  when KEXI_SERVER_SUPPORT is undefined
Startup
- added error message when explicity provided db driver name not found

2004-10-21

  (current editing is accepted)
- on failed row insert/update, user is informed 
  about "data_cancel_row_changes" action availability

  KEXI_SERVER_SUPPORT, KEXI_FORMS_SUPPORT added (currently all enabled by default)
Main
- copy/paste/cut on navigator items enabled only for KEXI_SHOW_UNIMPLEMENTED
- toolbars redesigned: now "design" toolbar is for kexipart's design view
  and "data" is for data view. This avoids toolbars duplication.
- propeditor dock window is hidden when a window in data view mode is active 
  (or no window is present). This feature is partially disabled 
  (using PROPEDITOR_VISIBILITY_CHANGES), though,
  --REENABLE when blinking and dock width changes will be removed in KMDI
- "data_cancel_row_changes" action added
KexiDB
- FORMAT CHANGED: SQLite Driver: 'date', 'datetime' and 'time' 
  types support fixed: Qt::ISODate format is used
- FieldList: simple methods made inline; fixed bug in hasField()
- findRef() instead of find() used in few places for speedup
- a hack needed because QVariant(QTime) has broken isNull():
  Internally: null time value is now null QDateTime(), not-null time value
  is now QDateTime(QDate(0,1,2),time); This allows to store 00:00:00 times.
  See also stringToHackedQTime(const QString& s).
Table Designer

KexiDB
- improved error handling
MySQL Driver

   overloads added allowing tables binding by position; addTable() now allows 
	 to specify table alias; tablePositionForAlias(), tablePositions() added;
	 many docs and examples added
SQL Parser
- many improvements and checks:
	-- ERR: there's no "persons" table in this query (alias "p" covers it)
	select persons.id from persons p;
	-- alias "p" for table "persons" is used
	select p.id from persons p;
	-- multiple aliases for the same table
	select persons.id from persons, persons p, persons p2


2004-09-15..16
SQL Parser
- select statements are now parser in more functional way, instead
  of using global pointers. This enables nested statements in the future.

	DriverBehaviour::QUOTATION_MARKS_FOR_IDENTIFIER.
Parser
- tokens like '123abc' are now reported as invalid by lexer to parser


2004-08-25
Core
- KexiSharedActionHost::invalidateSharedActions(QObject *o)
	if o is not KexiDialogBase or its child,
	only invalidate actions if these come from mainwindow's KActionCollection
	(thus part-actions are untouched when the focus is e.g. in the Property Editor.
- KexiViewBase::setDirty() -do not signal 'dirty' flag's changes if no change
- ObjectStatus now also stores related KexiDB::Obeject's, for more verbose errors
KexiDB
- Field::isAutoIncrementEnabled() added + some checks for 'autoincrement' flag
- fixed saving SQL statements for possible later error messages. 
  Object class now also better handles previous server error messages and numbers.
- KexiDB::getHTMLErrorMesage() improved, it's more verbose in certain cases
- Driver::escapeIdentifier() added; used in Connection in every place 
  where SQL statements are generated. Thanks to Martin Ellis.
CC_MAIL: m.a.ellis@ncl.ac.uk
TableView
- "yes" button for "do you want to delete row?" dlg has "Delete row" text 
  (as KDE HIG requires)
- cell-cursor's is position not reset after initDataContents() on show()
  if it was set before KexiTableView widget showing.
Table Designer
- many validations added related to primary key and autonumber properties
- On table creation (or altering), if there is no primary key, user is asked 
  if it should be added (automatically). 
  Useful setting "dont show this again" added for this as well.


2004-08-24
Table View
- redraw fixed -very special case: If you're during editing a new row, and click 
 on last (empty) row, and your newly entered row has no data in its cells,
 (what ends up with cancelRowEdit()), cursor is now moved one line up.
- unknown, non-printable key events are not ignored now, but passed to superclass;
  this e.g. fixes blocking ESC key in dialogs
- fixed setting cursor on row removing

2004-08-21
Table View
- Key_Left, Key_Right now by default behaves like Key_BackTab, Key_Tab
- KexiTableViewData::deleteRows(): refresh is requested only 
  if at least one row has been removed. This also magically fixed 
  a bug with missing vheaders in the Query Designer :)
Main Window
- opening object: if object is already opened but in other view, 
  its activated and switchToViewMode() is simply called. 
  This fixes switching GUIClient for "design" action called from the Navigator.
- Kexi::ViewMode is repaced with int type in most places 
  to ease future extensibility.

2004-08-20

  setting 'primaryKey' to true sets 'indexed', 'unique', etc. to true
Core
- KexiProperty, KexiPropertyBuffer: some operators added, operator [QCString] now
  returns KexiProperty, convenient operator = (QVariant) added; KexiProperty::null added
TODO: KexiProperty: add support for positive integers, "Auto" values e.g. for integer ==0
 like defined in QSpinBox. Reuse this in PropIntSpinBox.

2004-08-05
PropertyEditor
- Bool Editor: toggle button has now without ugly focus (space key still works)
- KexiPropertySubEditor:setWidget() focus proxy is set only if the widget has 
  non-zero focus policy.
- [+][-] branch box is better positioned; treeStepSize is now narrower
- font size is decreased to a reasonable minimum
Core

- DriverBehaviour::ROW_ID_FIELD_RETURNS_LAST_AUTOINCREMENTED_VALUE added
	 True if the value (fetched from field (or function) 
	 defined by ROW_ID_FIELD_NAME member) is EXACTLY the value if autoincremented field,
	 not just an implicit (internal) row number. Default value is false.
	 --used in Connection::lastInsertedAutoIncValue()
Table Designer
- saving changes to tables works now (data is just dropped, though);
  user is warned about this, when needed
- DataTable view is updated after saving table's design
- temporary data added; KexiAlterTable_DataView implemented
  (this fixes lack of updating datatable view after schema changes)

2004-07-28..2004-08-03
KexiDB
- ProjectDB FORMAT CHANGED (remains backward compatible):
- kexi__query* tables removed (to complicated, not needed since we 
  are primarily using kexi__objectdata and xml)
- Driver::IgnoreTransactions flag added: transactions are silently bypassed,
  (temporary, useful for current mysql driver implementation)
- Query Schema: QueryFieldInfo introduced:
  "select a as one, a as two from table" is now possible
  (two different aliases for the same field); 
  this also maintains field visibility.
- Most needed expression classes added (BaseExpr-derived)
- most debugs removed
- more debugString() methods added for few classes
- FieldList: removeField(), insertField() (at position) implemented

     statement is executed
  * Connection::resultCount() added: "SELECT COUNT() FROM (<statement>)" 
     statement is executed
- Cursor::open(): sets error message when needed
Query Designer
- KexiQueryView: shows error on failed execution

2004-07-22
Main

  and if it's dialog is opened, it's caption is updated as well.

2004-07-19
Kexi
- We've now --final-mode and --design-mode CL-options for completness.
KexiCore, KexiMain
- KexiStartupHandler introduced: handles startup actions, that 
 are new performed independently from Main Window's stuff. 
 We're now prepared to having 'startup mode' 
 database's property, which can be overriden by --final-* CL-options.
Form Designer
- A small fix to reduce widget flickering on resizing: 
  when we're dragging left, top-left or top
  handle, both size and position of widget changes. We're now hiding 
  the widget and showing it again after transformation.

2004-07-16
Form Designer
- some strings fixed

===================== Kexi 0.1 Beta 4 "FireDuck" =====================

2004-07-15
Forms

- fixed switching between Data and Design view

2004-07-12..13
KexiDB
- Connection: selectStatement(): "SELECT FROM ..." queries (ie. without columns) 
  are allowed (needed for desiger); omitting "FROM" allowed
KexiDB/Parser
- "SELECT FROM " rule added
Core
- KexiPart::Part::openInstance(): now virtual KexiDialogBase::loadSchemaData() is called
 what allows to reimplement stored schema data loading (reimpelemnted for queries)
- KexiDialogBase::dirty() now is true if any view is dirty
KexiTableView
- If ensureCellVisible() is called before table view is visible, it's (col,row) arguments are
 stored and ensureCellVisible() is called just after show event. This fixes invalid scrolling.
Query editor, Table Editor
- storage/ loading/ view switching/ dirty flag updating - improved

TableView
- "edit_delete" action is disabled for read-only tables

2004-07-09
KexiDB
- It's possible to define relationships for QuerySchema 
  (with Relationship objects)
- Connection: optimization: QString::reserve() used 
   before generationg SQL statements
- Connection::selectStatement() now generates joining rules 
  (i.e. relationships using WHERE)
Query Designer
- joins defined by GUI are now visible in SQL View

2004-07-08
Query Designer
- switching between design modes improved
- on generating sql from GUI: "*" added if no fields are picked
KexiMainWindow
- neverending-story: actions availability updating fixed
TableView
- KexiTableViewPropertyBuffer: all buffers are cleared when view's 
   data is cleared (using clear())
Relation Widget
- view clearing supported
Core
- KexiViewBase: 'dirty' flag is now better signaled to a dialog
KexiDB/SQL Parser
- lexer: USER_DEFINED_NAME now accepts also [0-9] (after 1st char)
- optional ';' is allowed at the end of top level statement
- dummy table is removed from query after parsing

2004-07-07
Core
- KexiDialogBase: Never Ending Story: Shared actions are invalidated on activate()
- ObjectStatus general purpose class introduced. KexiDialogBase now uses this 
  to indicate errors.
- KexiPart::Part: if newly opened dialog (KexiDialogBase) cannot display 1st view, it's closed 
 (via close()) and error message is set up
- KexiPart, KexiProject: 
  const Kexi::ObjectStatus& lastOperationStatus() added for not-kexidb errors
KexiMainWindow
- formpart is now available by default; menu for switching it off is hidden
- more errors taken from KexiProject are friendly displayed :)
Query GUI Editor
- saved layout (etc.) is loaded in afterSwitchFrom() for mode==Kexi::NoViewMode, 
  instead of doing it in the ctor
SQL View
- switching to other views improved: msgbox is displayed for invalid sql texts
- Intelligence Built In: we're doing our best to avoid regenerate the same 
query from almost unchanged sql text

2004-07-02..05
XMLGUI
- Tools menu added
- undo/redo global actions added
- tolbar setup consistent with ui_standards.rc and incoming katepart
Main Window
- hack: `window' menu moved right before settings menu
Widgets
- KexiSectionHeader: adding buttons connected to actions allowed on the right hand
- Relation View: saved table widgets' geometries are better setup on loading 
  (fix for differences between font sizes on differens computers)
- SQL Editor: better integration with katepart's actions using new shared action's API
Core
- KexiDialogBase now has activate(), deactivate() handlers, 
  KexiViewBase::updateActions(bool activated) is called for a current view
- Workaround found for integrating katepart's actions with Kexi's shared actions:
   - katepart KXMLGUIClient's KActions are now pluggable to KexiActionProxy
   - KXMLGUIClient's KAction::enabled(bool) signals are now automatically mapped 
      to KexiActionProxy::setAvailable(bool)
<TODO>: introduce KexiSharedXMLGUIClient class: 
  ctor: KexiSharedXMLGUIClient(KexiSharedActionHost *host, KXMLGUIClient *client).
  A single instance is created for particular xml file (eg. katepartui.rc) and inserted
  int KexiMainWindow's internal dictionary. This GUI client will be attached when needed 
  (ie. when given KexiViewBase object that is activated asks for this) and detached 
  when not needed. 
  showOnlyActions(QCStringList) - declares custom action list that will only be available
  In any time, no KActions will be created if these already are available globally 
  within KexiMainWindow.
</TODO>

2004-06-19
KexiTableView
- added checks if column is >=0 (this avoid crashes)
FormDesigner
- TabStopDialog: 
  * was badly implemented: exec() in ctor. exec() moved from ctor to

TODO: reenable this
	- setData(): when the same data object is passed, tableview is just refreshed
	- setDropsAtRowEnabled() added; row-droping-indicator implemented
	- KexiTableView::editor(): only if ignoreMissingEditor is false (the default),
	 and editor cannot be instantiated, current row editing (if present) is cancelled.
	 Thus: Now it's possible to edit data for tables where there are cells 
	 that have no valid editors (yet?), such as BLOB now.
	- paintCell(): if there is no editor defined, just a focus box is displayed,
	  filled with additional grayed diagonal pattern

	 (property editor was empty)
	- previous 'view mode' toggle action is checked back properly after cancelled switch
Table View
	- fixed editing initializing with 'removeOld' mode
Alter Table Dialog
	- Temporary workaround:
	 if data is dirty and table schema was saved before --user is asked 
	 for discarding changes.
	- switching to Data Mode is cancelled if current design is empty (never saved and !dirty)
KexiDialogBase
	- switchToViewMode() has now option for cancelling switching 
	 (if user is able to cancel in any case)
	- switchToViewMode() calls saveObject() on main window before switching, if needed
	- KexiViewBase::afterSwitchFrom() and beforeSwitchTo() have now bool &cancelled
		 parameter that allows to gently cancel switching 
		 (probably after showing some info messages)

2004-03-03
2004-03-02
Kexi Dialog / View 
	-fixed internal view's focusing: on click on a view, dialog is activated
	-focus cell is now grayed for disabled table views, not for unfocused
KexiDB
	-"kexi__parts" table is now filled with default (required) parts info
	  automatically in Connection::createDatabase(), not somewhere outside
TODO: add version info?
Main Window
	-Part type name removed MDI Taskbar buttons' captions, to save some space
	-User is now asked for saving object data on dialog closing (if it's dirty)
	-Not stored objects are removed from memory and gui completely, 
	 if user won't let to save them
	-Not stored objects (part instances) have now identifiers < than -1
Kexi Views/Dialogs

Parts / Kexi Project
	-so-called "unstoredItems" introduced, so they can initially exist in memory only 
	 and user may want to give up, not saving them
Table View
	-Fixed focus-stealing from editor problem

2004-02-27
Kexi Property Editor, Kexi Property Framework
	-propertyChanged() signal is received from assigned property buffer, 
	 and values are visually updated (including children)
	-changeProperty() code (for checking for changes)
	 moved from buffer to property setValue to avoid mistakes in class usage
	-property editor class now has a dict of all items, based on its names
	-each KexiProperty now has a pointer to its buffer, ans uses it to emit 
	 signals on value changes
	-fixed crash on moveEditor() when called from ctor
	-KexiPropertyEditor is safely updated right before PropertyBuffer destroying
Kexi Validator
	-allows to define whether empty values are ok or not

	 This removes confucion when user clicks on a spinbox arrow and it suddenly
	 moves left.
	-parent item is updated on children updates
	-editor position is updated when user collapses or expands a property node
	-resetting composed property value also resets all children
Kexi Property Framework
	-testiong for property change: for date and datetime types we're now comparing 
	 values using strings, because there can be miliseconds difference in a time;
	 strings comparison fixed for null strings
	-resetValue() added to KexiProperty for convenience
	-for composed properties (like Rect):
	  * changing property child updates parent value
	  * setting property unchanged (eg. on resetting) updates parent's 'changed' flag
	-QSizePolicy-type property helper improved
	-setValue() renamed to setChildValue() to remove messy overload

2004-02-24
Table View:
	-KexiTableViewData is now QObject-derived
	-signals like aboutToChangeCell() or rowChanged() moved from KexiTableView
	 to KexiTableViewData, so it'll be easier to reuse KexiTableViewData 
	 with a forms, and easier to share common data object between views.
	-It's now allowed to call acceptRowEdit() from inside of cell-accept handlers
		e.g.: KexiTableViewData::aboutToChangeCell() signal
	 (no infinite recursion is preformed but instead: the row is saved after
		cell's acception).
KexiDB:

 so LATER this may be also used for forms
--from-editor value getting errors (d->pEditor->value())
..is now signaled using message box

(or cell updating) is cancelled --> editor is not removed
- KexiPropertyBuffer: clear() reimplemented for proper clearing the data
- KexiValidator class introduced
KexiTableView:

  column is visible in the dropdown tv
--hidden the context menu
--hidden the record navigator
--added and used a method for selecting entire row, not just a cell

2003-12-30
** Many cleanups and behavioral fixes
- KexiMainWindow: 
  -focusing fixed again (now menubar doesn't grab move focus from navigator)
  -shared action set is now simplified, generalized
  -getlogin() used at least on win32, cause lack of KUser :)
- KexiDockBase added as a base for docked widgets hat offer shared actions. 
  Now it is a pair with KexiDialogBase class (both inherit KexiActionProxy).
- "Data" menu entry introduced
- KexiTableView:
  -added action for current cell removing
  -added popup menu
  -cell focus-marker is not grayed when popup menu is executed
  -Key_Space pressing fixed
  -added possibility for plugging shared actions to table view (using plugSharedAction()),
   e.g. "data_save_row" action, so shortcuts are properly handled
  -deleting row while new row is edited just cancels editing
  -vscrollbar tooltip is not visible when corliing is dont using keyboard instead of a mouse
  -stranger's key events (e.g. pressing up arrow in navigator's line edit) 
   aren't processed by table view (in keyPressEvent())

2003-12-22
- KexiTableView most keyboard events are now only accesible without key modifiers (eg. CTRL+Key_Up now 
doesn't work)

2003-12-21
- KexiActionProxy introduced
- New terms introduced: part's gui client and part instance's gui client. 
  The latter is removed from main window's guifactory when part instance is deactivated 
  e.g. "Filter" action of tablepart is hidden when needed),
  while the former is premanent in main window (e.g. "New Table" action is always visible).

- KexiMainWindow: 
  -dockwidgets' (like e.g. browser) focusing on main window's activate/deactivate 
   and on menu bar popups - fixed.
  -removed toolbar item's fileckering when we're closing one kexidialog and another kexidialog 
   of the same type (guiclient) has to be activated (solution: guiclients are removed not 
   on kexidialog closing but before activating another, it new activated dialog has different client.

- Global Action availability updates: 1) KexiMainWindow updates its actions on dialog switching, 
  or even on focusing dockwidget, like e.g. browser; 2) from dialog point of view - when required, 
  action availiability (true/false) is signalled from currently focused dialog to main window
- Browser: popup menu re-added, (there is also example how to plug 
  both custom and global actions to the popup)
- Opening part instances in design mode prepared (openInstance())

2003-12-20

- KexiDBTableViewColumn merged with KexiTableViewColumn, now column properties are always reused 
  from KexiDB::Field's properties

- KexiTableView: full handling of NULL or EMPTY values on editor accepting, e.g.:
   * cells are displayed as empty EVEN for numeric types, if null values are allowed
   * cell value is forced to NULL if empty values are not allowed (e.g.: for numeric types)

- Updating with NULL values fixed, and it's done only when needed.
- KexiTableView editors: pressing "left arrow" key at begginning of cell's text moves 
  to cell on the left hand; the same for end of text+right arrow key

- Finally: new row inserting works (no data integrity checking or warnings added though).

- KexiTableView: cells: fixed displaying of text (and text selection) longer than cell's width
- KexiDB: 
	-escapeString() and valueToSQL() moved from Connection to Driver
	-escaping ' and " chars fixed

  - above actions now work also after startup, from toolbar

- KexiPart::dbAvailable signal not needed since openProject() function returns boolean

- KexiStartupDialog:
  - KexiConnSelectorWidget reused
  - if single page is configured, no tabs are visible,

- small compiler issues fixed in pqxxconnection
   
2003-11-14
- Field: inlines fixed for newer compilers
- DriverManagerInternal::slotAppQuits() used to destroy all drivers
  on QApplication quit, so even if there are DriverManager's static
  instances that are destroyed on program "static destruction", 
  drivers are not kept after QApplication death.

2003-11-12
2003-11-13
- Kexi startup procedure for both files and db connections introduced

- Field: isNumericType(), isTextType() added, etc.;  
   type names are now i18n'd in an array;
   some methods inlined

TODO: void KexiTableView::cancelRowEdit() still dont repaint properly!!
TODO: update on lostfocus

- SQLiteConnection:: sqlite_freemem() used to free error message when needed;
	do the same for SQLiteCursor
- serverResult(), etc. methods aded also to Cursor class, so finer grained error 
  info is available

  
2003-11-04
- Documentation added for few newer and older methods.

2003-10-31
- KexiDB::Cursor: many code like drv_getNextRecord() moved from SQLiteCursor down 
  to Cursor class

2003-10-29
2003-10-30
- KexiStartupDialog added. Now, although it is project-and-connection-oriented, 
   it is designed to be still consistent with conventional document-driver startup 
   dialogs used for other Calligra apps.
- KexiProjectSelectorWidget introduced
- KexiProjectData structure added
- KexiProjectSet structure added
- Test for new KexiStartupDialog. Code written here will be reused for
  "fileopen" and "filenew" Kexi actions.

 - sorting works again
 - before sorting, row editing is cancelled
 - better "ensure visible" code when scrolling on small area
 - inserting rows code completed
 - vheader repaint fixed

2003-10-21
- tests/newapi : Now all test types accept <db_name>
- KexiTableView: 
 - page down key also move cursor to "insert row" if one is present
 - double clicking on cell (opening cell editor) fixed
 - fixed cell's repaint when autoscroll is performed after clicking cell at different row
 - sorting by column enabled, full set of methods added for this
 - new feature: empty row is appended right after start of editing new row (like in MSA), 
 to allow user to move to a next row
- KexiDB driver services' properties updated:
   - X-Kexi-DriverType=[File|Network]
   - and X-Kexi-FileDBDriverMime (for file-based drivers only; 
      for sqlite it is: application/x-sqlite)
   -MimeType property removed
- startup speed improoved: drivers lookup in KexiDB::DriverManager is now on demand.
- Driver name now reuses QObject::name()
- Connection::lastInsertedAutoIncValue() introduced

2003-10-19
- Connection::useTemporaryDatabaseIfNeeded() now is also reused 
  for databaseExists() and databaseNames(), so these methods work when engine 
  needs used any database before asking for info
- ConnectionPrivate::m_skip_databaseExists_check_in_useDatabase used
	to avoid endless recursion between useDatabase() and databaseExists()
	when useTemporaryDatabaseIfNeeded() is working
- Connection::setupKexiDBSystemSchema() added check to prevent creating 
 system tables schema more that once per connection

- Connection: reomved default values from useDatabase() and createDatabase()
	because this might be confusing to use first-found database name here; (thanks piggz!)
- FieldList: cached string == comma-separated list of fields added
- Connection: valueToSQL() overload added, insertRecord() overload added so we can omit 
	some fields from inserting; this is also internally used when kexi__* tables are 
	filled what improoves backward compatibility
- FieldList now offers lookup by field name, list of field names, it can create 
  subLists, usable to define list of fields for data inserting
- fixed compiler-dependent bug in insertRecord()

2003-10-18  
- Connection:
  - useTemporaryDatabaseIfNeeded() added - Because some engines need to have
   opened any database before executing administrative sql statements 
   like "create database" or "drop database",
   this method is used to use appropriate, existing database for this connection.
  - above method is now used in createDatabase() and dropDatabase() if needed.
  - QString anyAvailableDatabaseName() - returns name of any (e.g. first found) 
   database for this connection, eg. "template1" for PostgreSQL.
  - DriverBehaviour::ALWAYS_AVAILABLE_DATABASE_NAME added when hardcoded value 
   for above is enough.
  - setAvailableDatabaseName(const QString& dbName) - This is option that e.g. 
   application that make use of KexiDB library can set to tune connection 
   behaviour when it need to temporary connect to any database
   in the server to do some work (e.g. DROP DATABASE).
 - Connection cleaning up bug fixed a bit.
 - Naming Conventions document added
 - drv_isDatabaseUsed() introduced for additional state-checks

2003-10-17
- Driver developers should not change values of several important Connection
  class members, so these are now private.

2003-10-16
- KexiTableView:
 - maany repainting, updating, resizing improoved, code simplifications
 - editing row session introduced: edits for the same row is not accepted until move to another row
  This allows multiple fields editing before row editing accept.

2003-10-15
- missing QuerySchema::addAsterisk(QueryAsterisk *asterisk) added
- KexiTableView headers and cells repainting improoved
- for mysql driver: beh->ROW_ID_FIELD_NAME="_ROWID", is this ok?

2003-10-14
- DriverBehaviour::ROW_ID_FIELD_NAME added
- bool Driver::isValid() invented, it is so clever that obsolete or bad driver 
 can not be easily harmfull for application.
- KexiTableView and KexiDataTableView reimplemented for new KexiDB API.
- few classes renamed, e.g. KexiTableViewData is here now instead KexiTableList
- KexiTableViewData is now mostly data structure, special rows like "inserter" will be handled 
 by KexiTableView code. 
- KexiDataTableView now uses Cursor (a bit not efficient yet).

2003-10-13
- Cursor has now two ways for definition: 1) use raw statement 2) use QuerySchema
- Conenction: prepareQuery() accepting QuerySchema overload added 
- TableSchema::query() convenience function added
- tableview: QuerySchema is now used a bit
- QuerySchema(TableSchema* tableSchema) is created by defining 
 "all-tables query asterisk" (see QueryAsterisk) item. 
- Connection: implemented and selectStatement() replaced queryStatement() because 
 not only "select" queries will be implemented.
- QuerySchema::fieldsExpanded() convenient function added to expand query asterisks
- KexiDataTableView uses QuerySchema even smarter
- kexi/kexidb/tests moved to kexi/ to avoid curcular deps

2003-10-12
- Connection::isDatabaseUsed() fixed
- Connection: isConnected() is substituted with isDatabaseUsed() in some cases
	and checkIsDatabaseUsed() is substituted with checkConnected() in many cases.
- kexidb/tests/newapi tableview now uses KexiDataTableView
- Connection:: many overloads like queryStatement( KexiDB::QuerySchema& querySchema ) or
   executeQuery( QuerySchema& query, uint cursor_options = 0 ) added
- KexiDataTableView: simplified: setDataSet() -> setData(); record -> cursor

2003-10-11
- Transaction::isNull() fixed 
- now tables creation seems to be ok ('tests/newapi sqlite tables' works)
- sources synced again with win32 target
- kexidb/parser and kexidb/tests/parser ported to win32
- KexiDB::Expression introduced
- isSystemObjectName() now checks for "kexi__" prefixes
- checks on create table: if name is not system, if table is not empty, if fields are not system
- KexiDB::Reference introduced
- KexiDB::IndexSchema now contains informations about multiple related Reference objects
- kexidb/tests/newapi : now tests are functions, so can be called as subtests if needed;
   gui tests group added; tableview gui test introduced

2003-10-10
- FIX: creating kexidb system tables schema objects on useDatabase()
- KexiDB::Object::debugError() added for convenience
- Object: serverErrorMsg(), serverResult(), serverResultName(),
	drv_clearServerResult() added
- virtual Q_ULLONG Connection::drv_lastInsertRowID() added - returns unique
   identifier of last inserted row. 
- DriverBehaviour::AUTO_INCREMENT_FIELD_OPTION added; autoinc field's option is now 
	used in "CREATE TABLE" statement building; bool SPECIAL_AUTO_INCREMENT_DEF added
- fixed crash on mass transactions closing during closeDatabase()
- added tables creation subtest to kexidb/tests/newapi
- SQLite* classes: last operation's result is now stored for later checking

2003-10-09
KexiDB::Connection: 
- "select * from ..." substituted by "select <field name(s)> from ..."
  where possible, so after future kexi_* tables change it will still work.
- list of internally used kexi__* tables available with new static method
- bool TableSchema::isKexiDBSystem() added for tables that are internal for KexiDB
- bool SchemaData::isNative() added for objects that are native, ie. not contain additional
   metadata information.

- Connection::destroy() instead of Connection::disconnect() should be called 
  from xxxxConnection subclasses.
- ~TableSchema calls Connection::removeMe() so it is removed from tables list if needed
- ordering in Field object added
- quite hacky and thus effective insertRecord() overloads added
- some schema is added to kexi__* tables on createTable()
  
2003-10-07
- KexiDB::QueryAsterisk class introduced to define select queries with asterisks, like
 "staff.*" in "SELECT staff.*, cars.model from staff, cars WHERE staff.car = cars.number"
 (1st ttype) or "*" in "SELECT * from staff, cars WHERE staff.car = cars.number" (2nd type)
- Query schemas storage added
- using include path returned by 'mysql_config --mysql_config' as 
  is instead of eating mysql suffix
- Transaction::null and isNull() added
- Connection: Simulated AutoCommit feature implemented,
   createTable() added - it uses autocommit if enabled.

    TransactionData is used as internal driver-dependent storage
 - former Transaction class is now TransactionGuard
 - "default transaction" added to Conenction
 - SingleTransactions, MultipleTransactions and NestedTransactions added to KexiDB::Driver::Features
 - autoCommit option added to Connection (can use both driver-specific feature ans simulate),
    (not fully implemented yet)
 - active transactions are rolled back on database close
 - heavily commented :)
 - index.* moved to indexschema.*
 
2003-10-02
-KexiDB::
 - IndexSchema now inherits also from SchemaData (its additional 
    properties will be used at least in gui)
 - IndexSchema now points to a table that contains it, not connection
 - fixed owning rules for FieldList: not only TableSchema owns its fileds,
 	while QuerySchema, IndexSchema not
 - more methods moved to const 
 - QueryData offers now information about its parent table 

 - some record inserting introduced in Connection
 - yet more methods moved to const 
 - KexiDB version info added (both as functions and defines)
 - global definitions file added

2003-10-01
-KexiDB::
 - Table and query schemas now can be looked up using its id or name using Connection::tableSchema()
	and Connection::querySchema()
 - Connection::querySingleRecord() added for easy retrieval single (first) record 
	from query's result set
 - Cursor::storeCurrentRecord(RecordData &data) added: Puts current record's data into data
 	(makes a deep copy).
 - update after moving query.*, table.* file to queryschema.*, tableschema.*
 - Cursor buffering-related members moved from SQLiteCursor to Cursor
 - Cursor::moveFirst() fixed for buffered cursors - reopen() is now not needed
 - SQLiteCursor::drv_getNextRecord() we don't try to fetch records when 
    we know that buffer is already fully loaded.
- Uff, It is first time since ~3 moths I can see kexi main window after kexiDB change

2003-09-28
- KexiDB:
  - Table, Query and Index classes renamed to TableSchema, QuerySchema and IndexSchema
  - query schemas storage introduced
  - kexi__table 'system table' renamed to kexi__objects and for it now will be used for 
  storing also other types of objects, eg. queries. Some properties added to this table.
  - kexi__querydata added for query schemas
  - kexi__db added for storing database properties, e.g. kexidb version

2003-09-26
- new kexidb/newapi test added: dbcreation
- KexiDB::Connection::databaseExists() has now arg. that allows ignoring error messages (deflt)
- params for createDatabase() and useDatabase() are now optional for more convenient 
   use file-based drivers

2003-09-24
bool buffering_completed added to SQLiteCursor: true if we have already all
 records stored in the buffer

2003-09-18
- Buffered KexiDB::Cursor type introduced, for this type KexiDB::Cursor::isBuferred() is true;
	this is "test" implementation for SQLiteConnection only [INCOMPLETE]. 
	Cursor options introduced (Cursor::options()). Cursor's buffered flag if one these options.
	Options are now optional parameters both for protected Coursor's constructor and for 
	Conenction::executeQuery() and Conenction::prepareQuery()
- virtual bool Connection::drv_databaseExists( const QString &dbName ) added for optional 
	reimplementation. It is a pair with drv_getDatabasesList(), both are used in databaseExists() now.
	See comments for details.
- Connection::useDatabase(dbName) now do not allows dbName that do not exists, 
	while for single-db-per-connection-engines (eg. file-based engines) Connection::databaseExists()
	returns true only for single db name (eventually URL).
- for file drivers: file existence checks moved to databaseExists()
- in Conenction::useDatabase(dbName): closeDatabase() is called before other database should be used, 
	if there already was opened database.
- Connection::drv_getDatabasesList() has now default implementation that returns empty list.
- sources in drivers/mySQL/ updated just to work with kexidb API changes
- Connection::drv_databaseExists(dbName) is now by default just checking if dbName 
	is on the db names list
- Some code for bufering added - forward moving with buffered cursors looks
	better.

2003-09-17
- KexiDB::Query introduced: Table::name() and Query::name() moved to FieldList.
- Field::ListIterator FieldList::fieldsIterator(), Field::FieldList::debug() and clear() added

- removed kexidb/drivers/sqlite/driver directory: now we include sqlite.h from 3rdparty/kexisql/src/
- MySqlDriver's service name is "kexidb_mysqldriver", export macro is KEXIDB_MYSQL_DRIVER_EXPORT;
  win32 compilation fixed.

2003-09-15
- KexiDB::Cursor:
  - movePrev(), bof() added;
  - drv_getRecord() splitted to drv_getNextRecord(), drv_getPrevRecord()
  - fieldCount() added, not fully works yet
  - on open() we have always bof()==true and eof()==false
  - simplification: now bof() is computed as m_at==0
  - we are internally counting records from 1 and externally from 0
     (what is visible using at()).
  - m_at and thus at() has now Q_LLONG type

2003-09-14
- KexiDB::Object::setErrorMsg renamed to setError
- KexiDB::DriverManager is now just a container for one reference 
  to Internal Library's Driver Manager, so all you are expected to do is to remember
  about deleting KexiDB::DriverManager instance in your app.
  You can create many KexiDB::DriverManager objects.
- KexiDB lib now handles automatic deletion of drivers after last 
  KexiDB::DriverManager object deletion (thus refcount==0).
- tests/newapi now looks more simply at the end of main.cpp file :)
TODO: do the same with DriverManager as Driver
- KexiDB::Connection::tableSchema() updated for new KexiDB::Connection::executeQuery() semantic.
- DriverManager::self() no longer needed
TODO: add fieldCount() to Cursor

2003-09-13
KexiDB:
- Connection::prepareQuery() added for creating not opened cursors.
- Connection::executeQuery() now automatically opens the query with created cursor.
- Connection::destroy() convenient method added for obligatory use 
  in Conenction subclasses' dctors. destroy() just disconnets() and takes the Connection 
  object out of parent (Driver).
- SQLiteConnection updated for above requirements
- cursors and tabledefs are now deleted not in ~Connection but 
   on every Connection::disconnect().
- kexidb/tests/newapi also compiles with qmake and runs on unix
TODO: add auto removing Drivers on DriverManager deletion.

2003-09-12
Great day for KexiDB in cvs:
- Old KexiDB moved with actual Kexi version to non-default old_db_api branch.
- Current (HEAD) now contains new kexidb/ dir for with API
- kexidb/tests/ added to cvs with one 'newapi' test

2003-09-11
- Index::List and Field::List are now QPrrList<Field>, so Field objects are now stored as a pointers, 
	no as a values. These are owned by Table objects.

2003-09-10
- Html Doxygen-generated docs for KexiDB module configured
- KexiDB::Index introduced - definition of single table index (1 or multi-field)
- KexiDB::FieldList introduced - list of fields; base class for KexiDB::Index, KexiDB::Table
TODO: add KexiDB::Query and use this object eg. as argument for Cursor* Connection::executeQuery()

2003-09-09
kexidb:
- Every Connection object stores cursors opened with it. On Connection destruction, 
	cursors are deleted automatically. The same with table schemas within Connection object.
	QPtrDict is used for storing cursor objects.
- Every Driver object stores connection using QPtrDict, not QPtrList.
- Driver::isSystemObjectName(), Driver::isSystemFieldName() are case insensitive.

TODO: PROPOSAL: add compile-time option for kexidb to be kde-independent. 
	This could be quite easy.

2003-09-08
kexidb:
- QStringList Driver::systemNames() is now bool Driver isSystemObjectName() 
		-- Checks system object names, 
		eg. build-in system tables that cannot be used by user,
		and in most cases user even shouldn't see these. Specific for 
		a given driver implementation.
		For SQLITE driver system object names are these with prefix "sqlite_"
- QStringList isSystemFieldName( n ) added: return true if n is a system field names, 
		build-in system fields that cannot be used by user,
		and in most cases user even shouldn't see this. Specific for 
		a given driver implementation. 
		For SQLITE driver this has one system field name: "_ROWID_" (see CHANGELOG-Kexi-SQLITE).
- QString Connection::valueToSQL( const Field::Type ftype, QVariant& v )
		added for encoding values for sql queries
- Connection::createTableStatement(): unique, default and not null flags are now added.

TODO: also fields with UNIQUE flags should cause KexiDB::Table to have appropriate KexiDB::Index

2003-09-06
- new KexiDB is stored in "kexidb" subdir, old api in "kexiDB", on win32 in "kexidb_old"
-	virtual QString escapeString(const QString& str)
	virtual QCString escapeString(const QCString& str) added for Connection
- Field::setDefaultValue(const QCString& d) added. Default values are stored in 'f_default Text'
	field of kexi__fields table and are string-encoded there.

2003-09-04
- kexidb CHANGES FROM JOWENN: No ; after namespac, some d Pointers,
		littlebit different includes, littlebit modified destructors 

2003-09-01
	KexiDB::
	-	Cursor:: moveFirst(), moveLast(), moveNext(), eof(), at(), QVariant value(int i)
TODO: Cursor::value(int i) should use schema information to convert types of values
			(now all values are strings)
	-	Connection::tableSchema() - returns schema of given table retrieved 
			using connection's system kexi__* tables
	-	Connection::deleteCursor()
	-	Driver::sqlTypeName(int id_t) - returns sql type name for given driver
	-	static QString Driver::defaultSQLTypeName(int id_t) - returns sql type name for given 
driver
			(usable when we do not have Driver instance yet)
	-	Table::debug()
TODO: add default value storage

2003-08-29
- KexiDB::Cursor class, Cursor* KexiDB::Connection::executeQuery(statement) creates cursor
- KexiDB::Connection::drv_executeSQL(): executes query \a statement, but without returning resulting 
		rows (used mostly for functional queries).

2003-08-28
- KexiDB::Transaction helper class introduced, transaction-related methods added for KexiDB::Connection.
- drv_createTable() and createTableStatement() moved up to KexiDB::Connection

2003-08-27
- KexiDB::Table, KexiDB::Field classes introduced. 
	New DB-storage design started: kexi__table, kexi__fields system tables 
	(for db schema storage).

2003-07-28
- KexiDataTableView::tableSize() removed (wasn't this unnecessary?)

2003-07-26
- KexiRelationViewTableContainer: width is now based on maximum width of
the field name or header name. 
- KexiDataTable do not stores members  like KexiDB or KexiDBRecordSet bu
uses these from KexiDataTableView.

2003-07-25
- KexiDialogBase now also inherits from KXMLGUIClient for easy actions management.
	Do not make KXMLGUIClient subclass but just call setXMLFile() in KexiDialogBase:: subclasses' ctor
	and add actions to KexiDialogBase::actionColection().
- KexiRelationDialog:
	- now uses KXMLGUIClient to better utilize its actions
	- right-click context menus fully works
	- 'hide selected table', 'open selected table' actions added (unimpl.), kexirelationsview.rc 
added.
- Main Kexi menu bar little more standarized: 'Edit' menu added, 'View' menu moved just after Edit menu.
TODO: implement selected table hiding
TODO: implement selected table opening
TODO: add drag from browser

2003-07-24
- --open command line option added for automatic opening objects at startup, this will help in our 
	testing (see 'kexi --help' or main.cpp for details).
- KexiDialogBase got sizeHint() now that make it fit to qworkspace if it is a in-workspace window.
- virtual QString KexiProjectHandler::groupName() added that offers store plurar form of part name,
	while name() offers singular form.
- KexiRelationViewTable: 
	- list items (fields) without icons are aligned using transparent icons;
	- moving TableViews back from outside of scroll view area automatically shrinks scroll view's 
	area to smallest possible size
	- field that we drag over now is highlighted
TODO: fix KListView::viewportPaintEvent() like in KexiRelationViewTable::drawItemHighlighter()
      and commit to cvs (kdeui)
- KexiRelationViewTableContainer got now focus/unfocus/z-order functionality. Colors of table headers 
	are consistent with focusing and OS settings
TODO: fix connection lines painting

2003-07-23
- KexiTableView:
	- KexiTableViewPrivate d-pointer added with "kexitableview_p.h", "kexitableview_p.cpp"
	- Fixed repainting empty areas (background) in KexiTableView: QColorGroup::Base color is used.
	- editableOnDoubleClick(), setEmptyAreaColor() added
	- For Qt::Key_Menu key, context menu is show below the current cell, if available.
- KexiDialogBase reorganized. Now it offers more generic properties and functionality, 
	so subclasses can be more cleanly written and consistent with API and behaviour.
- Relations window is registered with 'kexi/relations' id, 
	while relations window embedded in query designer has id 'kexi/query/<query_name>/relations'
TODO: implement sizeHint() for KexiDialogBase subclasses
TODO: make open, create, delete and edit functions in KexiProjectHandlerProxy subclasses more generic

2003-07-22
- scrollbars enabled in KexiWorkspaceMDI

2003-07-21

	as "shell/new" in HKCR registry key on win32.
TODO: like above: "Print" and "Print to"

2003-07-18
- " " prepended to Project Browsers' list items' texts for better look (maybe add this feature 
	to KListView or make its generic subclass?)
- Some fixes with text positioning in tableview cells: float and date type y-offset, 
	date type editor frames removed
TODO: maybe optionally use KDateWidget (this needs to extend and improve this class)?
	QDateEdit is good enough (but this need to follow date format for locale or settings 
	using QDateEdit::Order, etc.).
TODO: fix KDatePicker (in kdeui): accepting with Return key or dblclick, and setting focus.
- KexiTableEdit has now QColorGroup::Base (usually: white) background
- KexiInputTableEdit has now some space on the left, so strings look better.

2003-07-17
- actions for Form, Kugar, Relations, Script Parts updated using KexiPartItemAction,
	KexiProjectHandlerProxy::groupContextMenu() and itemContextMenu()
	like in Tables and Queries' Parts
- kexikugarhandlerui.rc moved to kexi/data/
- 'Other Licenses' submenu made in 'Help' menu, 'Report Generator Licensing' 
	entry moved here from Kugar Part's popup menu
TODO: move this submenu after 'Error report' Entry (requires changes to calligra_shell.rc).
- kexirc added
- added option for KexiBrowserItem to be sorted in FIFO order (top level items - by default,
	others are sorted in alpha order). Visible Parts' order is now specified (by library name)
	in the Kexi's main config file "kexirc" ([Parts]/Order), because KTrader sorts parts 
	by name in aplha order. Unspecified Parts are appended at the end of list.
	This order setting is loaded and used on parts loading (KexiProject::loadHandlers()).

2003-07-16

- New Kexi icon updated for win32
- menubar and popupmenu entries in Query Part merged using KexiPartItemAction (new KAction subclass);

	action's information (avoid redundancy).
TODO: add delete_item action icon (equal "button_cancel" in crystalsvg) to the calligra/actions icons
TODO: like above, add "script" icon to kexi/actions ("moc_src" is used)

2003-07-01
