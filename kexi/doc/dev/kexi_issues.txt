| This document is expected to be independent of given KexiDB driver implementation,
| but proposals are described here after certain decisions:
| -drivers are (by current importance): SQLite (embedded), 
|  ODBC (universality reasons), Mysql (historical reasons), PostgreSQL
|

1. EXTENSION: Inheriting properties
	Kexi objects like tables, forms, reports can be put in sort of relation diagram:
	Easy example: form and report depends on table/query (or more tables and queries).

	This dependency can be called inheriting when we wnat to reuse as many 
	as possible properties of parent 'object' in child 'object'.

	Examples of these properties: table colors, columns widths, etc. can be 
	reused in forms/reports that use this its data.
	Inherited values can be of course changed for 'child' objects if needed.

	Other inherited properties example are custom error/warning messages 
	(see kexidb_issuses doc, #1).

	Properties inheritance makes database schema more rich and reduces required work 
	for later stages of the database project.
