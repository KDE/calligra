I clearly havnt been keeping this up to date!
Implemented a simple table based ODT renderer, supporting text and images.
Moved koreport plugins to /plugins so as not to clutter up the libs/ dir

06-Oct-2009
Finished most of the features of the widget.
Can now set column type and pkey state
Import now uses the new schema, and imports the data.

05-Oct-2009
Added a widget and model to the import dialog to allow altering column types
I think the import function is now best left in the dialog, using the functions from keximigrate

TODO:
Finish implementing widget
Add 'with data' bool option

TODO:

Steal dialog from csv import to allow change column types
Add 'with data' bool option
