See http://www.kexi-project.org/wiki/wikiview/index.php@AdvancedBuildNotes.html
for explanation how to conveniently set compile-time options.

List of available options
-------------------------

* KEXI_SHOW_UNFINISHED
Type: defined/undefined
Default: undefined
Description: If undefined, unfinished Kexi features (for example a few features
within Table Designer) will be hidded for Kexi, to avoid user confusion.

* KEXI_SHOW_UNIMPLEMENTED
Type: defined/undefined
Default: undefined
Description: If defined, forces to show menu entries and dialogs just to give 
impression about development plans of Kexi Team. 
Only recommended for test/development versions.

* KEXI_SCRIPTS_SUPPORT
Type: defined/undefined
Description: If defined, the scripts plugin will be compiled in and loaded;
else: it will be not loaded even if is compiled.
Default: defined

* KEXI_MACROS_SUPPORT
Type: defined/undefined
Like KEXI_SCRIPTS_SUPPORT macro, but for enabling macros plugin.
Default: undefined

* KEXI_NO_MIGRATION
Type: defined/undefined
Default: undefined
Description: If defined, data/project migration support for Kexi 
(available in Tools>Migration menu) will be disabled; else: support will 
be enabled.

* KEXI_NO_SUBFORM
Type: defined/undefined, temporary
Default: defined
Description: If defined, subform widget will not be available

* KEXI_NO_AUTOFIELD_WIDGET
Type: defined/undefined, temporary
Default: undefined for 1.x, defined for 2.x
Description: If defined, autofield (KexiDBFieldEdit) widget will not be available, 
nor dragging fields from "data source" will be available

* KEXI_NO_FORM_LAYOUTS
Type: defined/undefined, temporary
Default: undefined for 2.x
Description: If defined, layouts (and spacers) for forms will not be available

* KEXI_DEBUG_GUI
Type: defined/undefined
Default: defined (but should be undefined for final releases)
Description: If defined, showInternalDebugger=true (in [General] group) 
can be specified to display KexiDB Debugger. 
In the future the window will be probably used for debugging other features
like scripts or macros. This option is useful for Kexi Developers.

Also shows additional "Show Form UI Code" action in form's design mode. 
This is useful for debugging: after executing the action, 
a dialog with current (after changes) and original form's 
GUI XML code will be presented in a tabbed dialog, so you can compare what changed 
and look for possible problems. The "current" XML code will be saved when "save" 
action is executed. TODO: it will be merged with Internal Debuger window.

* KEXI_PROJECT_TEMPLATES
Type: defined/undefined
Default: defined
Description: Defined means Kexi offers project templates.

* KEXI_SQLITE_MIGRATION
Type: defined/undefined
Default: undefined
Description: If defined, sqlite3 migration to some newer format is supported
(users can see appropriate proposal on startup). Used in KexiStartup.cpp.
NOTE: Shall be defined.
