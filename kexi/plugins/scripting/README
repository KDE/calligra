Kexi Scripting README
---------------------

The code in this directory implements a scripting plugin for 
Kexi. The Kross Scripting Framework located at koffice/libs/kross
is used to embed scripting interpreters and access Kexi
functionality from within those interpreters.

/kexiscripting/
The scripting-plugin which will be loaded by Kexi at startup to
embed Kross into Kexi.

/kexiapp/
Access to a running Kexi application. Kexi itself takes care of 
publishing it's KexiMainWindowImpl instance and the kexiapp-plugin 
provides access to some of the applications functionality at runtime.

/kexidb/
Kross-plugin to provide nearly the whole KexiDB-framework to scripting
interpreters. That way we are able to read/write from/to all by KexiDB
supported databases.

/scripts/
Kexi-dependend scripts. This directory holds our in python or ruby
written scripting extensions. Those extensions are just plugins for
Kexi to extend it's functionality.
