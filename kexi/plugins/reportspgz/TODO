Properly sync size/pos properties between the editor and the item
Make koproperty faster
Make report entities (label/field etc) plugins, so its easier to add new ones

Investigate using Kross for the scripting backend
Add 'on render' events to sections as they are rendered
Add functions for drawing (lines, circles, rectangles etc) from script that draw in a section
