it will be used by kformula part and in the future it may replace the 
libkformula.

./kformulatest

Supported actions include:

Please note that the key bindings are for testing only. The library
is meant to be used with KActions. Look at KFormulaContainer::createActions.


And yes, we do have syntax highlighting! Just type:

y = e ^ - o m e g a <space> t <space> ( a * s i n ( o m e g a <space> t <space> + b * c o s ( o m e g a <space> t

or, if you prefer

s i n <space> ^ 2 <space> ( a l p h a <space> <space> + c o s <space> ^ 2 <space> ( a l p h a <space> <space> = 1

There is some truth in it!


Hint: Press <space> on a name that is not a symbol to select it.
