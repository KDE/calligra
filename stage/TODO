BUGS :
======
- Placing of objects is not precise

TO FINISH:
===========
- Presentation structure editor/viewer
- Group objects (resizing is fucked up, set properties doesn't work)

MISSING FEATURES / TODO:
==============================
- Current "align objects" aligns in relation with the page, is there a
  way to align the h or v centers of several objects ?
- use libkformula (or better, make a KPart out of it)
- separate the general configuration and page/slide specific config dialog
  and make 2 out of them (currently it's one, which is confusing)
- use GM in all dialogs
- Rewrite autoforms (using XML)
- Possibility to print 1, 2 or 4 slides / page
- Menu item for copy page (to do it without copy+paste)
- Extend Contents to Height => Fit contents to height (also shrink spacings!)
  Maybe donï¿½t only change spacings but also fontsizes
- Make option for txt obj to be abe to set a few colors and automatically use
  them in this order for the paragraphs (like always one in black and one in blue and
  again and again)
- Synchronize object background and page background => object can't load picture and page can't use different brush type.

Calligra in general:
=======================
- koTemplateChooseDia:
  - Restart with last presentation (suggesting it in initial "open" dialog)
    (using kapp->getConfig)


KPresenter after calligra 1.3
============================
Todo:
- Create compatibility for saving in old format for page effect speed.
- Put in zip format copy/paste object to dnd between OO and calligra


In Progress:
-> copy/paste element as oasis format
	-> copy object (In Progress)

Done:
-> copy/paste element as oasis format
    -> duplicate page 
	-> copy page 
	-> create template
-> Hide/show header/footer by page (allow by oasis format)
-> implement custom slide show

        -> pie
        -> text object
        -> ellipse
        -> group object
        -> polygon object
        -> polyline object (all attributes)
-> save/load page background
-> save/load object background
-> save/load page effect (hide/show effect)
-> save/load page sound effect
-> save/load object effect
-> save/load notes
-> save/load stroke line
-> save/load shadow object
-> save/load page layout
-> save/load sound page effect
-> save/load picture object
-> save/load page background image
-> save/load animation group
-> save/load sticky object
-> save/load closed element (defined as polygon into oo spec draw:polygon)
-> save/load picture effect
	-> bright
	-> contrast
	-> intensity channel (green/blue/red)
	-> grayscal

-> save/load object transparency
-> save/load header/footer object
-> save/load display header/footer
-> save/load regular polygon
-> save/load variable settings
-> Save/load masterpage
-> save/load in old format master page attribute

Todo:
-> save/load cubic/quadric/freehand object (define as svg object)
-> save/load picture effect
	-> picture effect (extend oasis format)
	-> depth
	-> mirror type (we must use rotate and draw:mirror element)

Bugs:
-> fix default value
-> fix some arrow style  

In Progress:
-> save/load background of master page (save works not perfect)
-> save/load picture effect
-> save/load protect object
-> save/load embedded object

After calligra-1.4
-> allow to move object outside page (ask by boiko)
