Some usefull stuff:              
You can search the source code for FIXME and TODO entries with:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"

Using -A and -B with grep gives you some additional context around the particular comment:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -A 3 -B 3 -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 5 main areas to work on before koffice 2.0:
1) Port to kde4.
2) Improve the gui. (Take advantage of the new qt4 possibilities)
3) Improve scheduling functionality. This can be done by:
   * Improving the existing scheduling code, or
   * Switching to taskjuggler.
     Atm. (29-03-2006) I (Dag Andersen) am in contact with Chris Schlaeger 
     and we're investigating problems/possibilities.
4) Improve koffice integration.
5) Work on XML file format towards a odf standard.

Note that the decision on 3) above may severly influence the TODO list below.
The list is not sorted in any order, allthough more urgent things tend to
gravitate to the top.

Taken       User manual (contact: raphael.langerhorst@kdemail.net)
            
            Find a solution for the durationwidget.
            It's now a custom widget mainly comprised by QLineEdits.
            This doesn't work well. One problem is that QLineEdit gives
            sizehints of approx 14 charachters minimum and we use 2-3, so
            it messes up layouting.
            
            Resourceuseview: Scrap existing and use KChart instead.
            Removed for now. Charting probably not added until after release.
            
            Reports: Review if/how Kugar should be used and
            design a few usefull reports.

            Task details view: Improve, make it stand-alone? Convert to
            a "infoview"? (as todos in KDE-PIM?)
            
            Cut, copy, paste.
            
            Start-to-finish relation.
            
            Improve menu- and toolbar structure.

            Icons. Would be nice to have a set with a consistent look.
            
            Templates
            
            Add tooltips and what's this.
            
            Better handling of resources during scheduling.
            - Use Overtime
            - Allow/prohibit overbooking
            - Resource leveling
            - Monte carlo estimation
            - etc
            
            Calendars:
            - Timezone handling
            - Default calendar (See also Bug 123682)
            - Localized holiday files (as in kdepim)

            Improve Progress info dialog/presentation.
            Make it stand-alone, add to task context menu.

            KDGantt:
            - Static/global IDs for items and tasklink groups.
            - Presentation of "week-ends" when it doesn't match scale.
            - Time-now line.
            - Progress for event (milestone) item.
            
            Settings/configuration

            Implement periodic/repetitive tasks.
            
            Implement external events
            
            Implementing subproject editor-dialog
            Subproject is not supported.
            
            Handle (re-)calculation of started/finished tasks.
            
            Restrict modification of started/finished tasks.

            Interface to PIM
            - Issue todos and docs
            - Fetch freebusy info (Prob: how to sync if we recalculate?)

            Decide on the final KPlato file format.
            For now we have these options:
              * leave the format the way it is
              * create a new (OASIS?) specification
              * use PMXML - http://www.projectoffice.com/xml/xml.asp
              * or find a better suited "standard" format
                  http://proj.chbs.dk/specifications/

            
            Make it possible to form resource teams.
            
            Make it possible to request resource allocations from groups.
            
            Write good doxygen compatible API docs in the source code!
            
            Taskjuggler???
            
            Change source filenames to 'classname'.cpp and d:o .h
            Eg: kpttask.cc -> Task.cpp kpttask.h -> Task.h
            Also remove the .ui filename prefix.
