.SH NAME
kivio \- a flowcharting program for the KDE Office Suite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kivio
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.I kivio
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fIKivio\fP is a flowcharting program that offers basic flowcharting
abilities, but with a twist.  Objects are scriptable, and a backend plugin
system offers the ability to make objects do just about anything.
.PP
Feed it a directory of C++ header files, or even Java files, and let it
generate a graphical class map for you.  Give it a network and let it
explore and map out the network for you.  All this is possible through
the scripting/plugin architecture Kivio possesses.
.PP
This application is part of the KDE Office Suite.

Run
.I kivio --help
