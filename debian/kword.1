.SH NAME
kword \- a word processor for the KDE Office Suite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kword
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.I kword
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fIKWord\fP is a frame-based wordprocessor comparable to FrameMaker.  It
can be used for desktop publishing, but also for "normal" wordprocessing
(like writing letters, reports and so on).
.PP
This application is part of the KDE Office Suite.
.PP
Run
.I kword --help
for more information.
