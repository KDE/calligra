KDE Office Suite for Debian
---------------------------

Package koffice is a metapackage that depends on the core components of
the KDE Office Suite and suggests the remaining components.

The documentation for each application is in the corresponding
/usr/share/doc/<package>/ directory (for instance, /usr/share/doc/kword/,
/usr/share/doc/kspread/ and so on).
