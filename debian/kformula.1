.SH NAME
kformula \- a formula editor for the KDE Office Suite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kformula
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.I kformula
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fIKFormula\fP is an easy to use formula editor. It provides the basic
input facilities and the support functionality you come to expect of a
KOffice application. But there is more. Some of its most exciting
features are:
.PP
.RS
Easy Greek letter insertion
.PP
Intelligent cursor movement
.PP
Advanced syntax highlighting
.PP
Multi-level undo support
.PP
LaTeX export (copy and paste into a text editor)
.RE
.PP
KFormula uses the KOffice formula drawing library. If you have to deal
with many formulae you may wish to use a KFormula object embedded in
KWord or KSpread.
.PP
This application is part of the KDE Office Suite.

Run
