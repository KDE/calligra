In short, the performance of the MSWrite Import Filter, is bad.

On i686, it takes 20 seconds to import a 200K (text-only) document,
because 1.5MB of XML is generated.

Of those 20 seconds, only 2 seconds are taken by my filter code --
approximately the same time it takes for MSWord97 (yes, I do mean Word97,
not KWord :)) to fully import the entire document.

The remaining time is taken, I assume, to process the excessive XML that
the filter produces.

Steps are being taken to drastically reduce the amount of XML produced.
"In the mean time, you can wait" :)

Actually, if you can help, then please email me. :)
