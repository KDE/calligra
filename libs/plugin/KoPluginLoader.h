/**
 * The pluginloader singleton is responsible for loading the plugins
 * that it's asked to load. It keeps track of which servicetypes it
 * has seen and doesn't reload them. The plugins need to inherit
 * a QObject with a default constructor. Inside the default
 * constructor you can create whatever object you want and add it to
 * whatever registry you prefer. After having been constructed, your plugin
 * will be deleted, so do all you need in the constructor.  Things like
 * adding a factory to a registry make sense there.
 * Example header file;
 * @code
 * #include <QObject>
 * 
 * class MyPlugin : public QObject {
 *    Q_OBJECT
 * public:
 *    MyPlugin(QObject *parent, const QVariantList & );
 *    ~MyPlugin() {}
 * };
 * @endcode
 * Example cpp file;
 * @code
 * #include "MyPlugin.h"
 * #include <kpluginfactory.h>
 * 
 * K_PLUGIN_FACTORY_WITH_JSON(MyPluginFactory, "myplugin.json", registerPlugin<MyPlugin>();)
 * 
 * MyPlugin::MyPlugin( QObject *parent, const QVariantList& ) : QObject(parent) {
 *    // do stuff like creating a factory and adding it to the
 *    // registry instance.
 * }
 * #include <MyPlugin.moc>
