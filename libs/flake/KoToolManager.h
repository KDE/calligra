/**
 * This class manages the activation and deactivation of tools for
 * each input device.
 *
 * Managing the active tool and switching tool based on various variables.
 *
 * The state of the toolbox will be the same for all views in the process so practically
 * you can say we have one toolbox per application instance (process).  Implementation
 * does not allow one widget to be in more then one view, so we just make sure the toolbox
 * is hidden in not-in-focus views.
 *
 * The ToolManager is a singleton and will manage all views in all applications that
 * are loaded in this process. This means you will have to register and unregister your view.
 * When creating your new view you should use a KoCanvasController() and register that
 * with the ToolManager like this:
@code
    MyGuiWidget::MyGuiWidget() {
        m_canvasController = new KoCanvasController(this);
        m_canvasController->setCanvas(m_canvas);
        KoToolManager::instance()->addControllers(m_canvasController));
    }
    MyGuiWidget::~MyGuiWidget() {
        KoToolManager::instance()->removeCanvasController(m_canvasController);
    }
@endcode
 *
 * For a new view that extends KoView all you need to do is implement KoView::createToolBox()
 *
 * KoToolManager also keeps track of the current tool based on a
   complex set of conditions and heuristics:

   - there is one active tool per KoCanvasController (and there is one KoCanvasController
     per view, because this is a class with scrollbars and a zoomlevel and so on)
   - for every pointing device (determined by the unique id of tablet,
     or 0 for mice -- you may have more than one mouse attached, but
     Qt cannot distinquish between them, there is an associated tool.
   - depending on things like tablet leave/enter proximity, incoming
     mouse or tablet events and a little timer (that gets stopped when
     we know what is what), the active pointing device is determined,
     and the active tool is set accordingly.

   Nota bene: if you use KoToolManager and register your canvases with
   it you no longer have to manually implement methods to route mouse,
   tablet, key or wheel events to the active tool. In fact, it's no
   longer interesting to you which tool is active; you can safely
   route the paint event through KoToolProxy::paint().

   (The reason the input events are handled completely by the
   toolmanager and the paint events not is that, generally speaking,
   it's okay if the tools get the input events first, but you want to
   paint your shapes or other canvas stuff first and only then paint
   the tool stuff.)
