Kudesigner:
- show properties AFTER selection
- correct changing of the property value for 
- automatic resize of property editor
- saving the position and size of the property editor
- correct multiple selection and deselection for items
- selection of the template itself (on click)
- selection and resize boxes for report sections
     ___________________
    / Report Section  + \______________
    |                    
- print and print preview
- property editing for multiple selections
- Z-Ordering (right-click menu) for report items
    default: all items are created with the same z-position 
- open x-kugarmixed files ???
- print and print preview
- do not allow to move report items out of their section

- optimizations:
-- create property editors only once
-- do not repaint selected items during selection
-- remove unnesesary canvas_item->hide() and show()
-- same for canvas()->update()


Kugar engine:
-  Add FieldList element to the Detail element (for Kexi):
    <!ELEMENT FieldList (Field+)>
    <!ELEMENT Field>
    <!ATTLIST Field
	Name CDATA #REQUIRED
	Type CDATA #IMPLIED>
-  Add direct database support into the engine (maybe):
    DTD can be extended to allow:
	<DataSource Name="" ParentName="" Driver=""
		 	Database="" HostName="" Port=""
	        	Query="" Username="" Password="">
		<DataField X="" Y="" ... />
		<Label ... />
	</DataSource>					
	<DataDetail Height="" DataSource="">
	</DataDetail>				
-  Review the progress updating in the engine - use either percentages or Page
   n of m.  Integrate properly with the Konqueror status bar.
-  The engine should also report (through signals) the current page and the
   total number of pages so that the GUI can display them on the status line.
-  Look at adding some chart types.
-  For some template elements we want the user (ie. the data DTD) to be able
   to optionally override them to give them some local control over the
   format, eg. paper size.
-  Improve the error reporting - particularly about bad XML.


Kugar shell(part):
- ???? review of current development status needed ???? (to Joseph Wenninger)
- --print --from <number> --to <number> --copies <number> --printer <name>
    AD: have some pathes for kugar/lib and kugar/shell (deprecated shell)
