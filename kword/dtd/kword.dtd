This is an XML document type definition (DTD) for the KWord document format.
Written by Kalle Dalheimer <kalle@kde.org> with (obviously) input from KWord's
author Reginald Stadlbauer <reggie@kde.org>.

Kword DTD version 2 has been created by Thomas Zander, but only small adjustments from
the original version were made.


About the version
-----------------

This is the DTD version 2, for KWord-1.0.
It has changed a bit since the DTD version 1, for KWord-0.8 (the one included in KDE-2.0)
KWord will read the previous versions of its own file format but this is considered
the most complete format, we highly encourage you to use this format.


KWord overview
--------------

The main structure of each KWord document is a header and a body. The header
contains things like the paper size, the margins and so on.

The body is organised around the concept of frames. You might have noticed
that you can do nearly everything with the frames in your KWord document (e.g.
move them around, interlock them, let your text "flow" through them, etc.). To
achieve this flexibility, the body actually has to store the data in a
hierarchy including framesets, frames, paragraphs, and so on.

Framesets hold the actual text. Frames represent the rectangles in which this
text is "flowed".


Some basic notes on XML
-----------------------

- All kinds of numbers are stored like this: foo="1" (between " and " :)

- A rational number looks like this: width="1.03" (note: the '.' separates
integer and fractional parts).

- <XYZ foo="100" bar="0"/> equals <XYZ foo="100" bar="0"></XYZ>

- Unicode-letters (UTF-8 compressed) are used to store the text

- Some special characters ('<', '>', '&') are "escaped" ('&lt;', '&gt;', '&amp;')

- Please launch Kword and save an empty file - it is much easier to follow
this documentation if you wade through an (almost empty) example document.

- The XML begins with a special tag like this:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Each file starts with this tag. Note: You must not "close" this tag (i.e.
don't put a </?xml...> at the end of the file!).

-->

<!--    A KWord document consists of a paper description, a number of
        attributes and the framesets which contain the actual data. It
        can also define a number of styles.

        Attributes:

            editor:         The program this file was written with.

            mime:           The MIME type (must always have the value
                            application/x-kword).

            syntaxVersion:  Integer version of the syntax in the remainder of
                            this file:

                                1...as for KWord 0.8 and for KWord 1.0
                            It's the same version since KWord can read both formats,
                            so it doesn't need to know before hand.

        A paragraph and a style can have counter data.
        The document will do the counting of the paragraphs that use this.

        type:   0 = None
                1 = Numeral
                2 = Alphabetical
                3 = Alphabetical uppercase
                4 = Roman numbering
                5 = Roman numbering uppercase
                6 = Custom bullet (one char, set by the 'bullet' attribute)
                7 = Custom (complex string, see kword's dialog)
                8 = Circle bullet
                9 = Square bullet
                10 = Disc bullet

        depth   The level of the numbering. 
                Depth of 0 means the major numbering. (1, 2, 3...)
                Depth of 1 is 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc.

        start   The first used number in the numbering (usually 1).
        numberingtype
                0 = list numbering, 1 = chapter numbering.
                List numbering starts at <start> everytime another list is used (everytime a 
                non numbering paragraph has been used)
                Chapter numbering is used throughout the whole document (in future throughout books)
        lefttext
                The text that is printed left of the first numeral
        righttext
                The text that is printed right of the last numeral
                A usual value for this one is "." (dot).

        bullet  The character code (in UTF-8) that is the custom bullet (for type=6)
        bulletfont
                The font to use for the custom bullet can be found in (use "symbol" if in doubt)
