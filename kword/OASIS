Notes about the use of the OpenDocument format in kword:
-------------------------------------------------

* Tables
In OpenDocument, tables are treated like paragraphs.
In KWord, tables are either "inline as character" or "at a fixed position".
This gives three cases:
  + inline table, alone in its paragraph -> can be saved the OpenDocument way.
  + inline table with other things in the paragraph -> wrapper frame+textbox needed
       The wrapper frame is marked with a koffice-specific attribute, koffice:is-wrapper-frame="true".
       Upon loading, the wrapper textbox is removed if it doesn't contain anything else.
  + fixed-position table -> wrapper frame+textbox would be needed here too.
       But anyway those tables are very difficult to handle, and offer nothing
       compared to "putting an inline table in a non-inline textbox", so I have disabled them.

* Frame behavior on new pages
KWord supports "What happens on new page: create a new frame and reconnect, no followup, make copy."
OpenDocument doesn't, but this doesn't matter, it doesn't affect rendering of existing documents, only editing.
So we save this with a koffice:frame-behavior-on-new-page attribute, possible values:
followup, copy or none. Default value: copy for header/footers, none otherwise.

* DTP
KWord supports both the normal word processing (paragraphs directly inside the body)
and the page-based DTP mode (page-sequence element).

* Headers and footers
OpenDocument supports odd/even headers and footers using "header" and "header-left".
But for first page header/footer KWord should create a separate page layout,
this is not done yet (it uses its own tag instead, as a temporary hack).
Also OpenDocument doesn't allow a different style for header and header-left,
so they must have the same min-size, border, margins...

* Columns
OpenDocument has "number of columns" and "space between columns", so it's OK for kword.
OOo however also supports columns of different sizes and with different spaces, we can't load that.

Notes about interoperability with OpenOffice.org-2.0:
-----------------------------------------------------

List of bugs in OOo-1.9.113 affecting interoperability:
 - <text:notes-configuration text:note-class="footnote"...> uses 0-based values for text:start-value instead of 1-based (private mail sent)
 - DTP mode not really supported; but even with single page, frames are misplaced (private mail sent)
 - <text:numbered-paragraph> isn't loaded!!! http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=52127

List of bugs in OOo-1.9.113 not affecting interoperability:
 - style:text-underline-type="single" is missing for underlined text, only style is specified (code has workaround)
 - display-levels not respected in chapters.odt

List of features that KWord has, but OOo doesn't have, and which are in the OpenDocument standard:
 - OOo doesn't load nor save the cursor-position processing instruction 
 - DTP mode (page-sequence)
 - frame break (we model it with fo:break-after="column" in the paragraph style)
 - copy-frames (probably)
 - hyphenation bool as character property, for more control (probably)
 - diagonal lines in table cells (probably)
 - line style for footnote separator (probably)
 - table templates (probably)
 - DTP mode using the draw:page element (probably)
 - (after 1.0) border around a word or any run of text (probably)

List of features that KWord doesn't have, and which OpenDocument has:
 (that list would be quite long, but let's list the real-life interoperability problems)
 - lack of section support (changes of page layout, but also changes of column settings
   in the middle of a page)
   We could at least keep section styles and section markers (begin/end),
    so that load+save preserves it.
 - some anchoring options are not supported, e.g. paragraph-anchored frames. We load
    them as page-anchored frames, but this means the placement is wrong, obviously.

Differences in rendering:
 - In KWord endnotes are right under the end of the text; in OOo they are on a separate page.
