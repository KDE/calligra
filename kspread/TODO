Things to do before the release of KOffice 2.0
==============================================

Item                                                               Prio Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regressions
-----------
* Autofill							      1 DONE
  Fix it. Works, if you comment out the undo creation. Probably since
  the KCommand to QUndoCommand.
* Border (l,r,t,b & outline)					      1 DONE
  Redo does not work.
* Auto-Format							      1 DONE
  Undo does not work.

General bugs
------------
* Autofill							      1 ----
  Fix the 'May'-may-be-a-short-or-long-month issue.

Filter bugs
-----------

Things not in bugzilla
----------------------

* Printing
  + printouts with zoom other than 100% (it's a missing feature, but  2 done
    the GUI is there... - page layout, options, Scale Printout )
  + make print range work over more than 1 page			      2 done
  + Repeated rows and columns don't work if they don't start from     2 ----
    row/column 1.   Also it is not possible to enter just one
    row/column into the dialog, it always has to be a range (2:3).
    - Make it possible to enter just one row/column into GUI, don't   2 done
      force a range.
  + Insert manual page break					      2 ----
  + Print selection only					      2 done

* OpenDocument file format
  - see OASIS.txt						      1 ----
  - Fix loading of named styles					      1 done
  - Fix loading order of columns, rows and cells		      1 done

* OpenFormula compliance (Medium group)
  - implement all functions of the Small and Medium group	      1 ----
    see koffice/kspread/functions/TODO
  - implement the calculation settings				      1 ----
    see section 8.5.2 in [1] and section 3.3 in [2]

* Flake integration.
  + Provide a table shape					      1 done
  + General shape support					      1 done
  + Cell anchoring						      1 ----
    - Saving								----
      Query the shape container of the sheet before iterating over
      the cells. Store the shapes anchored in cells in a QHash. Put
      that into a saving context and pass it to the cell saving
      methods. Write out the shape at the appropriate place.
    - Interaction							----
      Shapes anchored cells should be moved, if the cell itself
      got moved; either by column/row/cell range insertions/deletions
      or by column/row dimension changes.
  + Move all the managers and other necessary logic from Doc to Map	done
    in order to use Map solely as data center for embedded tables.

* Internals (See also DESIGN.html)
  + Painting    						      1 DONE
    Use a 'CellWindow' to store CellViews for the the currently
    visible cells. This 'CellWindow' will create and delete CellViews
    if necessary, but reuses existing ones. This approach will enable
    us to decouple the CellViews from the Cells. This in turn will
    enable us to cache each and every attribute related to the cell
    painting, which is currently not possible because of memory
    consumption. Caching the attributes should make the painting
    way faster.

  + Zooming							      1 DONE
    Make it view dependent and not document dependent.

  + Cell Storage						      1 STEF
    - Move all cell attributes to separate storages.			done
    - Undo for LinkStorage (insert/remove columns/rows/cell ranges)	done
    - Undo for FusionStorage (insert/remove columns/rows/cell ranges)	done
    - Move all storages out of Sheet.					done
      This CellStorage (SuperStorage) should provide methods to iterate
      over the non-empty cells, i.e. those that have at least one
      attribute. All getter and setter should be moved from Sheet to
      this super storage.
    - Merge new Cell Storage into trunk					done
    - A common undo object.						done
      Provide a startUndoRecord() and a stopUndoRecord() method.
      On stopping the recording an undo data object containing all
      necessary data for each storage is returned. Provide a method
      that takes such an undo data object and performs the undo.
      For each storage one has to store a list/vector. If empty, those
      take just the size of a pointer.
      The undo process will than be in one place and the undo data
      object can be stored on the heap. By just passing its pointer
      around the undo data object can be implemented as a private
      class of the super storage.
    - (Re-)Adjust the saving algos to use the new (old) iteration	----
      functionality.
    - Rewrite the MergeManipulator to work directly on the CellStorage.	----
    - PointStorage: Implement setLoadingEnabled(bool) that switches	----
      the insertion method to a mode in which the value, column and
      row are just appended to the vectors.
    - Point-/RectStorage: All yet stored data is implicitly shared.	----
      Make use of this fact: Implement book-keeping with a hash and
      reuse the already stored values. This is already done in
      StyleStorage.

  + Style Storage						      1 STEF
    This would dramatically reduce memory consumption and allows
    styles for empty cells.
    - Merge new Style Storage into trunk				done
    - Remove old Format							done
    - reuse existing sub-styles (book-keeping)				done
      Done on a per substyle basis.
      Lookup: O(n)
      n: number of different aggregations of a substyle,
         e.g. red, blue, etc. for the background color substyle
    - Garbage collection						done
      Every minute a list of pairs, consisting of a rect and a
      substyle, is filled. Every now and then one pair is checked
      wether it's obsolete.
    - Keep track of the used area.					done
      Styled cells do not necessarily occur in the cluster anymore.
      Same goes for rows and columns.
    - Speedup the OpenDocument loading by 'collecting' the used area	done
      of each style and insert a minimal set of rectangles into the
      style storage.
    - Undo of style changes						done
      This should insert the inverse substyles or something similar.
    - Add insertion/deletion of columns/rows				done
    - OpenDocument loading/saving					done
    - Old native format loading/saving					done
    - Replace Cell::format() by Cell::style().				done
    - Move the StyleManipulator class into the FormatManipulators file	done
      and rename the file to StyleManipulators.
    - Fix the border outline operation.					done
    - Port the filters.							done
    - Decouple validity and conditions from cells.			done
    - Fix named styles.							done
    - Check for orphaned (nonDefault)Cell lookups.			done
    - Extend the Storage template to the StyleStorage level.		done
      - Garbage collection						done
      - Book-keeping							done
      - Used area tracking						done
      - Cache								done
    - Improve the caching of the styles.				done
    - Insertion/deletion of cell ranges.				done
    - Fix garbage collection.						done
      Remove only data rectangles, that are completely covered.
    - Seek & destroy R-Tree data rects, if they get empty after		done
      deletion of columns/rows, but store them for undo.
    - Port FormatDialog.						done
    - Port IncreaseIndentManipulator.					done
    - Port BorderColorManipulator.					done
    - Undo for insertion/deletion of columns/rows.			done
    - Undo for insertion/deletion of cell ranges.			done
    - Improve the saving.						----
      Only StyleStorage::Private::usedArea should track the occupied
      cells only - not those of columns or rows. Adjust the saving algo
      appropriately.
    - Fix Style::isDefault(). Use the StyleManager's default style.	done
    - Get rid of KSpread::Style::Currency. Use KSpread::Currency.	done
    - Add configure option to choose wether the style of the current	----
      or of the previous (default) column/row is used on insertion.
    - Launch the garbage collection in a separate thread.		----
    - Garbage collection triggering.					done
      Currently, every minute the whole tree is filled in as possible
      garbage and each piece is checked when time allows. To avoid the
      check of the whole tree every minute (at worst), the changed
      region's rectangle/data pairs are marked as possible garbage.
    - Revisit Style::loadXML(), Style::saveXML(). Check copy&paste!	done

  + Speed up selection.						      1 DONE
    - Clipped selection painting.					done
      Provide a SelectionDamage. On selection changes the changed cell
      range is already calculated. Now, use this changed cell region,
      convert it into view coordinates and set QPainter's clip region
      appropriately.

  + Non-continguous selection					      2 DONE
    Convert the operations to work on non-contiguous selections.
    - InsertColumn							done
    - InsertRow								done
    - DeleteColumn							done
    - DeleteRow								done
    - Insert cells							done
    - Delete cells							done

  + Commands							      2 ----
    Convert UndoActions and related logic to Commands.
    - Copy								done
      Can't be undone -> not necessary
    - Delete								done
    - Cut								done
      Consists of Copy and Delete -> undoing by undoing Delete
    - Paste								----
    - Paste Special							----
    - Paste with insertion						----
    - InsertColumn							done
    - InsertRow								done
    - DeleteColumn							done
    - DeleteRow								done
    - Insert cells							done
    - Delete cells							done
    - Autofill sequence							done

  + Rich text in cells.						      1 ----
    - Use KoText.    							----
    - Background spell check (necessary to have rich text)		----

  + Evaluation of how best to increase floating point precision.      3 ----
	Suggestion:  GnuMP.    (Tomas)
	This will work by converting all functions to compute using
	ValueCalc, and nothing else, then modifying Value* to
	support GnuMP.  The conversion step shall be done as a part
	of converting to the new parser.

  + Damage concept						      1 DONE
    - Split the damage processing: document and view related.		done

  + code cleanups						      3 ----
    - Merge Cell::checkForNamedAreas() into Oasis::decodeFormula().	done
      Caution: also used by OpenCalc filter
    - Check if all logic of Point and Range is materialized in Region.	done
      Replace all occurences of Point and Range by Region.
    - All util_foo() functions that act on Point/Ranges should become	done
      static members of Region.
    - Move all util_foo() functions to 'Util' namespace and remove	done
      the prefix 'util_'.
    - Reduce amount of parameters for methods which takes many of	----
      them, e.g. Sheet::paste(). bools -> QFlags, static variables
    - Revisit Conditions class.						done
      Make it an implicitly shared class - like Style.
    - Revisit Validity class.						done
      Make it an implicitly shared class - like Style.
    - Move Cell::testValidity() into Validity class.			done

* GUI
  + Indent and multiline doesn't work together			      2 ----
  + RegionSelector						      2 ----
    - add syntax highlighting
    - intialize choice on focus in events, if necessary
    - fix the line edit height
    - implement single cell restriction (maybe in Selection)
    - jump back to parent dialog on closing the mini dialog
  + Scrollbar that supports jumping one row/column forward or back    2 ----

* Formula/Value engine
  + DependencyManager / RecalcManager				      1 DONE
    - The reference depth changes only if a formula was altered. So,	done
      it belongs to the DependencyManager and has to be moved. OTOH,
      it is only use for recalculation. If this is disabled, the
      reference depth is useless. Therefore, we have to respect the
      automatic recalc setting.
    - Move Cell::calc() to RecalcManager.				done
    - Emit an appropriate Damage after cell/col/row insertion/deletion.	done

  + Named areas							      1 DONE
    - Update on cell/col/row insertion/deletion.			done
      Maybe refactor the code to have a separate manager for the named
      areas and store them in a RectStorage; similar to Binding storage.

  + Value							      1 DONE
    - Support datetimes (again)						done
    - Distinct complex type						done

  + Matrix operations						      2 ----
    - Determinant							done
    - Dimension								----
    - Inverse								done
    - Minima/Maxima elements						----
    - Multiply								done
    - Norm								----
    - Rank								----
    - Transpose								done

  + Locked areas (for formulas with a matrix as result)		      2 DONE
    - Move the unlocking/checking from CellStorage to the preprocessing done
      of the Commands. Copy/paste operations need a special handling
      unless they are converted to Commands.

  + References to cells in other files				      2 ----

  + Tools->Auditing:						      2 ----
    - Trace Precedents						        ----
    - Trace Dependants						        ----
    - Trace Error						        ----
    - Remove all arrows						        ----


* General features
  + Split view							      1 ----
  + "Freeze/Unfreeze Panes"					      2 ----
  + Function optimizer ('Solver')				      2 ----
    - evaluate, if we're able to use linear methods (derivatives!)	----
    - evaluate, how to include side conditions				----
    - check wether the formula cell carries a valid formulas		----
      and further checks of used cell contents


* Major features (big effort)
  + Pivot tables						      3 ----
  + Scenarios							      3 ----
    See [1], section 8.3.3 for details.

******************************************************************************
Please everyone working on KSpread:

Get yourself a copy of Excel 97 or 2000 and create
a really big sheet, and I mean really big and insert Graphs and
lots of dependencies and regressions etc. use external add-ins if you have any
and real time links. Make links between sheets and then see how
well Excel behaves.

1. UNDERSTAND that putting a spread->recalc() or spread->recalc(true) in
your code is an abosolute NO-NO! Complex spreadsheets with possible
heavy mathematical calculations via dll/so add-ins as well as real
time feeds will not be managable if you do not painstakingly check
wether spread->getAutoCalc() is true.


2. Learn to understand that without the
following short cut actions you are lost ( try to scroll
down a list of 10,000 obersvations ...not using CTRL Down
for example)

CTRL Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Shift Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Home/End
CTRL Shift Home/End
Shift F9 versus F9

Let's try to get them working well in Kspread as well. I tried my
hand at it but wasn't able to get them to be efficient.

3. Familiarize yourself with the concept of array formulas and why they
are necessary (area protection, partial argument evaluation) Who would
be willing to implement them? This will be an absolute must if we
want to make progress on the mathematical/financial/statistical
function side of things. I would be willing to implement a miriad
of these functions but I believe doing that without having array
formulae first will be a big mistake.

(In case you wonder why I feel so strongly about these things:
I am a professional user of Excel. I eat, sleap and work with Excel
on my trading desk on Wall-Street.)
