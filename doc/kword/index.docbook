</itemizedlist>

<para>
All &koffice; applications were designed from the beginning to take
advantage of the features of &kde;. Because of this, &kword; (like
all of &koffice;), supports many advanced features you expect from todays desktop environment.
</para>

<para>
&kword; is a word-processor which can work either as a traditional word
processor, or as a simple but powerful desktop publishing
application. This is possible because &kword; is a frame oriented word
processor, not a page oriented word processor (&Microsoft;
<application>Word</application>,&Wordperfect;
and <application>Applixware</application> are all page oriented word
processors).
</para>

<para>
Frame oriented word processors work by creating one or more
<emphasis>frames</emphasis> per page. Each frame acts as a boundary (like
a frame which surrounds a photograph), which limits the text to the
boundaries of the frame.  You can move and re-size boundaries to define
exactly where on the page the text will be placed.  As you re-size
frames, the text is reworked to fit within these frames.
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata format="PNG" fileref="intro1.png" align="center"/>
        </imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>Button</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
You can easily <emphasis>connect</emphasis> one frame to the next. When
you connect two frames, any text which does not fit within the first
frame, flows easily and automatically into the next.
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata format="PNG" fileref="intro2.png"
               align="center"/> </imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>Button</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>
In addition to text, you can include virtually anything inside a frame.
A frame can contain a spreadsheet, pictures, a database form,
or nearly any piece of data. Since each page can have any number of
frames, documents can appear quite sophisticated while still remaining
easy to edit.
</para>

<para>
&kword; users also benefit from the auto wrap features of &kword;. When
you place one frame on top of part of another frame, the text from the
<emphasis>lowest</emphasis> frame can be automatically wrapped around
the newly created frame. This reformatting occurs in a
<acronym>WYSIWYG</acronym> Graphical User Interface, and happens
automatically while you edit.

<para>
As a word-processor, &kword; includes the most used options of many other
word processors, while maintaining a simple interface. In addition to
the features you expect from a modern word-processing package (text
entry, bold face, italics, text alignment, text printing, &etc;),
&kword; can:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Use predefined templates, to generate complex document layout with
one click of the mouse. As a user, you can build your own templates,
download templates from the web, or use the current document to create a
new template.</para>

KPart using the tools designed for that task, without needing to start
the application at all.</para>

<title>Detailed Guides: Document Layout</title>

<para>This section of the guide is designed to help the user with the format and layout of their
documents.  The section will begin with information on changing the size and shape of the page
and the margins, and work progressively through smaller and smaller
blocks of text (frames, then paragraphs, then characters). At each level, all of the format and
layout options will be explained.</para>

<para>After discussing the formatting of individual characters, the manual will elaborate on styles
(to provide consistent formatting through the document), lists, multi-column documents, tables and finally the use of headers
and footers in a document.</para>

<para>&kword; has the ability (with varying success) to load data
from foreign (non-&koffice;) data files.  &kword; also has the ability to
save data as non-&koffice; data files.  This is provided to help users
of &kword; to interact more seamlessly with people who use other
operating systems and wordprocessors.</para>

<para>&kword; does this by loading a non-&koffice; datafile into
memory and passing the data through a <emphasis>filter</emphasis>
to extract as much information as possible from the data file.  Some
formatting information will be lost or changed by the filter in the
attempt.</para>

<para>When &kword; reads data <emphasis>into</emphasis>
&kword; from a non-&koffice; file format, it is
<emphasis>importing</emphasis> the data.</para>


<para>When &kword; saves a &kword; document as a non-&koffice;
file format, it is <emphasis>exporting</emphasis> the data.</para>

<glossterm>Aspect Ratio</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>This is the ratio of the measurement of a screen, picture or document
horizontally compared to the vertical measurement.  All standard
computer monitors have the same aspect ratio, regardless of their
resolution. Any &kword; document that conforms to the standard
screen will look good on any monitor.</para>
<para>For many images, it is important to maintain the aspect ratio.  This prevents
distortion to the picture.</para>
</glossdef>

<glossentry id="defbinarycode">
<glossterm>Binary code</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>Binary code is the actual instructions for the computer. So if we
refer to <emphasis>binaries</emphasis> we mean the executable &kword;
program.  While computers have no difficulties reading binary files,
they are not easily understood by people.  Compare this distribution method to <glossterm

<glossentry id="defbitmap">
<glossterm>Bitmap Image</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>Bit mapped images are composed of individual dots.  This type of
file is very good for photographs and complex drawings. The downside of
using bitmap images, is that when you change the size of the image on
the page, there is a loss of detail. The file names of such pictures
often end in <emphasis>jpeg</emphasis>, <emphasis>png</emphasis> or
<emphasis>gif</emphasis>. </para>
</glossdef>

<glossentry id="defcell">

</glossdef>
</glossentry>

<glossentry id="defclipboard">
<glossterm>Clipboard</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>The clipboard is a temporary storage area in memory.  Whenever you
use the <guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem> or
<guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> command, you are placing the object that
was selected into this memory location.  Then when you use the
<guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> command, you insert the information
from the clipboard into the document.  For more information see the
section on <link linkend="clipboard">Cut/Copy/Paste</link>.</para>
</glossdef>

<glossentry id="defcompiling">
<glossterm>Compiling</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>When you compile a program, you are converting it from
a source file (which is easily edited by a programmer) into a binary
file (which the computer uses). Compare this distribution method to <glossterm
linkend="defbinarycode">Binary Code</glossterm>.</para>  
<para>Compiling programs
is not as easy as installing binary versions. Users who are only interested in 
using &kword; are encouraged to find a binary version of &kword; for their computer.  For 
users who want to learn more about programming, more information on compiling &kword; is

<glossentry id="defdeb">
<glossterm>DEB</glossterm>

<para>This is a binary file format that is used by Debian and Debian-based

<para>A dialog box is a small window that appears on top of your working

<glossentry id="deffilemask">
<glossterm>File Mask</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>A file mask can be thought of as a strainer for you.  On the
average computer, there are several thousand files. These files are
sorted into sub-directories, but it is not uncommon for many users to
have 100's of data files in a single sub-directory.</para>
<para>Fortunately for us, most applications use a suffix to their
filenames.  By applying a file mask, &kword; will only show you the
files which are not filtered out by the mask. (That is to say &kword;
only shows the files that fit through the strainer).  This can be
helpful if you have many files from many different applications. The
file mask is incorporated in the <guilabel>Filter:</guilabel> line of
the save and load dialog boxes.</para>
<para>As an example. If you use a file mask for &kword; files, the file
mask will try to filter out all files that are not for

<para>A filter takes a document file from one program (&eg; &Microsoft;

<glossterm>Frame</glossterm>

<para>Nearly everything in &kword; is in a frame. Text is always in
