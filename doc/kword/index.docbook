<chapter ID="todo"><title>Current status of this manual</title>
<warning><para>This manual is out of date in many areas.  Over the past two months, KOffice has continued to evolve into the start of a powerful office suite.  During that time, however, my time has been short for updating the documentation for KWord because of the tremendous need to document all of the new and updated applications in KDE 2.0.  Because of this, the KWord documentation has fallen behind.</para>
<para>KWord has not changed drastically in how it operates, but you may find that many of the details of the interface have changed.  This will be corrected ASAP.</para>
<para>If any of you out there are interested in helping the KDE documentation team, please feel free to send me a message at <email>mmcbride@ematic.com</email></para>

<para>I want to make this very clear.  This is a first draft (of many).  My initial goal, is to get a good start on every section of this documentation.  After this first draft is complete, I will rework each section again for more clairity/completeness.  </para>
<para>I would be very interested in any part of KWord that people find particularly difficult or confusing.  You can either write me directly, or post your comments on the koffice mailing list (which I faithfully read).  These comments will help me focus the documentation better.</para>
<para>You may also notice (if you are reading this closely at all), that sections of this guide will often end abruptly with "STUFF".  This is a marker to remind myself that more needs to be added, or the section needs to be worked on again.</para>

<para>All KOffice applications were designed from the beginning to take advantage KDE 2.0. Because of this, <application>KWord</application> (like all of KOffice), supports drag and drop, themes, and many other advanced features you expect from todays desktop environment.</para>

<para><application>KWord</application> is a wordprocessor which can work either as a traditional word processor, or as a simple but powerful desktop publishing application.  This is possible because <application>KWord</application> is a frame oriented word processor, not a page oriented word processor (<application>Microsoft Word</application>, <application>Word Perfect</application> and <application>Applixware</application> are all page oriented word processors).</para>

<para>Frame oriented word processors work by creating one or more "frames" per page.  Each frame acts as a boundry (like a frame which surrounds a photograph), which limits the text to the boundries of the frame.  You can move and reshape these boundries, to define exactly where on the page the text will be placed.  As you resize frames, the text layout is reworked to fit within these frames.  You can easily "connect" one frame to the next.  When you connect two frames, any text which does not fit within the first frame, flows easily and automatically into the next.  In addition to text, you can include virtually anything inside a frame.  A frame can contain a spreadsheet, clipart, pictures, a database form, or nearly any piece of data.  Since each page can have any number of frames, documents can appear quite sophisticated while still remaining easy to edit.</para>
<para> Kword users also benefit from the auto wrap featurs in KWord.  When you place one frame on top of part of another frame, the text from the "lowest" frame can be automatically wrapped around the newly created frame.  This reformating all occurs in a WYSIWYG Graphical User Interface, and occurs as you edit.</para>

<para>KWord simplifies the creation of new pages (at the users option), by automatically creating frames for the next page, using the current page as a blueprint. This eliminates the need for the user to re-define the frame boundries for each page.</para>

<para>As a wordprocessor, KWord includes the most used options of many other word processors, while maintaing a simple interface.  In addition to the features you expect from a modern wordprocessing package (text entry, bold face, italics, text alignment, text printing, etc), KWord can:</para>

<chapter id="Fundimental"><title>Fundimentals</title><para>This next section is designed to show you how to start <application>KWord</application> and some basic but important concepts you should understand when using KW</para>

</orderedlist></para></sect1>
<sect1 id="TemplateIntro"><title>An Introduction to Templates</title>
<para>OK, so the first question you may have is:</para>
<para><emphasis>Why do I need to use a frames based word processor, when I am perfectly happy writing my letters on my current, page oriented, word processor? </emphasis></para>
<para>Well the good news is, adjusting to a frames based word processor is easy and once you select a template, <application>KWord</application> will act just like the page oriented wordprocessor you are used to.  There are templates available for simple correspondance and day to day use. </para>
<para>When you need to generate a more complex document (newsletters, posters, etc), however, you will not need to switch to a different program to generate these special documents.  There are templates which will help you generate your newsletters or other more complicated documents. </para>
<para>OK. So now that you are willing to give this a try, we should talk briefly about what templates are, what templates can do for you and how you work with templates. </para>
<para><Emphasis>What are templates and what can they do for me</Emphasis></para>
<para>A template can be thought of as an initial mold for your document.  When we sit down to write a document, we already have an idea of what the final product will look like.  If you are writing a letter to a business, you want a document with only one column, which goes all the way accross the page, and from top to bottom of the page.
When you sit down to author a newsletter for a local organization, however, you may want a large title accross the top, and several columns for quick news articles. </para>
<para>With &kword;, you can use this preplanned notion of how your document should look and using a template, you can create a set of frames to approximate this final layout.  For your business letter, you can select one large frame that covers the page from top to bottom and side to side (excluding margins of course).  For that newsletter, however, you may decide that a two or three column document is more to your liking.  Once you select this template, KWord will create the frames for you. </para>
<para><Emphasis>What if I decide later to change my layout</Emphasis></para>
<para>This is not a problem.  If you begin your document as a single column document and decide later that two columns is better for your needs, you can add another column.  The purpose of templates is not to limit your ability to change your format, but rather to take some of the work load off you whenever possible.
Choosing the correct template when you begin your document will simplify the formating (as opposed to always selecting the default template and making your changes later.), but it is also important to remember that choosing the wrong template will not increase your work when compared to page-oriented word processors. </para>
<para><Emphasis>Working with frames (aka Your First Document) </Emphasis></para>
<para>The following section, consists of two fundimental topics which you should understand before we continue, and a step by step walk through of the most important functions you will need to understand to complete a complex document.  We will generate the start of a newsletter using this tutorial.  If you do not want to complete the tutorial, or have questions about a specific aspect of frames, you can use the following to jump directly to that section of the tutorial: </para>

<para>This tutorial is designed to be done in order, starting with <link linkend="WPVSDTP">The difference between Normal and Publishing templates</link></para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="WPVSDTP"> 
<title>The difference between Normal and Publishing templates</title>
<para>Before we begin with the tutorial, it is important that the difference between Publishing and Normal templates is clear in your mind. </para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><Term>Normal</Term><listitem><para>The Normal templates are designed to act like page-oriented wordprocessors.  When you select a Normal template, you will create a template with one or more frames.  The first frameset is distinctly ti
ed to the paper size of your document.  When you increase or decrease the paper size, the frame size is automatically adjusted.  You are <emphasis>not</emphasis> able to move this frame around on the page and you cannot delete this frame. If you need to adjust the size or position of this frame, you must <link linkend="PageFormat">adjust the margins</link> to adjust the frame position or size.  On top of the first frame, you can, of course, add additional frames.  These frames can contain pictures, text or whatever you want.  These new frames can be moved, resized and deleted to suit your needs. If you want it, KWord will even wrap the text from the first frame around any information in any subsiquent frames.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><Term>Publishing</Term><listitem><para>These templates are designed for desktop publishing.  When you select a template from this class, all of the frames are "created equal".  This is where the difference between Publishing and Normal template lies.  None of the frames in a Publishing template are tied to the page as tightly as the main frame in a Normal template is. Each of the frames is independent of the page size, and can be moved or resized without changing margins, etc.  Of course this also means that altering the margins or papersize of your document requires that you individually move/resize each frame.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<para>As you can see, the choice between Publishing and Normal templates is a choice between flexibility (Publishing) and convenince (Normal).  You can create any document you like with either type of template.
</para>
<para>If the concept of templates is unclear, please follow along with the following step by step.  The first document you will create will use a publishing template.  This should help clairify exactly how templates function.</para></sect1>
<sect1 id="TextandFrame"> <title>The difference between Text Edit mode and Frame Edit mode</title>
<para>Before we begin the tutorial, there is one other feature of <application>KWord</application> we should cover.</para>
<para>If you think about it, most documents consist of two separate but often interrelated components:
<orderedlist Numeration="Arabic">
<listitem><para>The content, which consists of text you enter through the keyboard, the pictures you have on your hard disk, the data in your spreadsheet, etc.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The layout, which consists of how the information is given to the reader.  Multiple columns, boxes surrounding text, italics for emphasis, etc.  </para></listitem>
</orderedlist></para>
<para>This same division exists when using KWord. </para>
<para>KWord has two modes of operations:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Text Edit Mode</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Frame Edit Mode</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Text Edit Mode is most commonly used for the <emphasis>entry of the content</emphasis> of the document.  In Text Edit Mode, you enter text from the keyboard, cut and paste from other applications, build tables for your data, etc.   </para>
<para>Frame Edit Mode is most commonly used for the <emphasis>layout</emphasis> of the document.  Using Frame Edit Mode, you can adjust the width of text, resize pictures, etc.</para>
<para>This is not to say that you will never enter content from Frame Edit Mode, and never alter layout in the Text Edit Mode, but you will find that most often the previous guides will serve you well.</para>
<para>You can enter Text Edit Mode using the menu by selecting: <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit Text</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, by pressing F4, or by clicking on the Text Edit toolbar button 
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="PNG" fileref="textmode.png" align="center"></imageobject><textobject><phrase>Button</phrase></textobject></inlinemediaobject></para>
<para>You can enter Frame Edit Mode using the menu by selecting: <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit Frame</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, by pressing F5, or by clicking on the Frame  Edit toolbar button <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="PNG" fileref="framemode.png"></imageobject><textobject><phrase>Button</phrase></textobject></inlinemediaobject> </para>
<para> Now that we have discussed the differences between publishing and normal templates and introduced the differences between Text Edit Mode and Frame Edit Mode, we will begin the tutorial</para></sect1>

<para>Also, you will notice a red rectangle on each screenshot.  This rectangle outlines the next object you will need to push/change/click/etc.  Obviously a red rectangle will not appear when you are running &kword;.</para></note>

<para>When you first start KWord (or <link linkend="File">start a new document</link> after KWord is running), a dialog appears.</para>

<sect1 id="Rulers"><title>Using Rulers</title>
<para>Along the left and top edges of the Document area, are a horizontal and a vertical ruler.</para>
<para>These rulers measure from the top right edge of the page. </para>
<para>Each ruler has a bright area surrounded by a dark area.  The bright area shows the size and location of the currently selected frame on that page.  As you change frames, the bright area changes to reflect the new frame's settings.</para>
<para>The ruler can measure the page in 3 units of measure:</para>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para>Milimeters (mm) - This is the default</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Points (pt)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Inches (in)</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>To change the units of the ruler, place the mouse cursor over one of the rulers (either one), and click with the right button on your mouse.</para>
<para>Select your choice from the submenu.  You will notice both rulers change to the new unit of measure.</para>
<para>You may also notice two verticle arrows (one pointed up, the other pointed down), on the right side of the bright area of the ruler. These are used to adjust the margin of a paragraph.  For more information, see the section entitled <link linkend="Formatpara">Formatting Paragraphs.</link></para>
<para>Finally, you may see some black marks, which are not part of the ruler.  They may appear as "L" shaped, a "Reverse-L", an Upside-down "T", or an Upside-down "T" with a dot in it.  These are location of tab stops.  For more information see the section entitled <link linkend="TabStops">Using Tab Stops</link>.</para>

<sect1 id="NewDoc"><title>Beginning a New Document</title>
<para>Starting a new document can be done 5 ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>You can start KWord from the KDE Panel.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>You can start KWord from the command line by typing<screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>kword &amp</command></screen></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You can use the keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>N</keycap></keycombo></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>or by clicking <inlinegraphic fileref="filenew2" format="png" align="center"></inlinegraphic> on the toolbar.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>However you begin a new document, a dialog box appears:</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="ChooseTempDia" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>This dialog box allows you to:</para>
<itemizedlist spacing=compact>
<listitem><para><link linkend="newdoctemp">Start a New document from a template</link></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><link linkend="Loading">Open a previously saved document</link></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><link linkend="emptydoc">Start an "Empty" document.(default)</link></para></listitem>

Start and Empty document (<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>)</para>
<para>If you use the keyboard shortcuts, you will need to press Enter on the keyboard or click "OK" to confirm your selection.</para></tip>
<para><emphasis><anchor id="newdoctemp">Starting a new document from a template</emphasis></para>
<para>In order to start a new document based on a template, you must first choose your template.</para>
<para>Remember templates are either Normal or Publish templates. If you need to review the differences, click <link linkend="WPVSDTP">here</link>.</para>
<para>You can use the tabs labled Normal and Publish to display all the available templates of that group.</para>
<para>Once you are on the correct tab, you are shown all the available templates, each with a title and a small icon which shows you the general layout of the template. </para>
<tip><para>&kword; comes with two standard template groups. You can add new tabs by installing outside templates, or creating templates of your own.</para></tip>
<para>To select your template, click on it with the left button.  The selected template will be highlighted.  Confirm your choice by clicking the OK button. This will begin a new document with that template.</para>
<para><emphasis><anchor id="emptydoc">Starting an "Empty" document</emphasis></para>
<para>This is the default action, and begins a new document in Wordprocessing Mode, with one frame per page.  
This is an excellent choice for every day correspondance, or general word processing.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="Saving"><title>Saving a Document</title>
<para>Once you have entered text and data into a document, you will usually want to save this to a file on your hard drive.</para>
<sect2 id="CmdSave"><title>The "Save" Command</title>
<para>The "Save" command can be invoked 3 ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>By selecting <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu Bar</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>You can use the keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>S</keycap></keycombo></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>or by clicking <inlinegraphic fileref="filefloppy" format="png" align="center"></inlinegraphic> on the toolbar.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Any of these methods results in the same action by KWord.</para>
<para>By selecting the "Save" command, you are instructing KWord to save the file under the current filename. You will not be given the option to change the filename or its location. If you want to change the name of the file, or where it is saved, you must select <link linkend="CmdSaveAs"><menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem></menuchoice></link> from the Menu bar.</para>
<para>If you have not saved this file before, it does not have a filename.  KWord automatically executes the <link linkend="CmdSaveAs">"Save As..."</link> command so you can provide a file name. </para>
<para>KWord does not report a sucessful save.  Therefore, if the file was saved without incident, KWord will return you to editing your document.  If there is a probelm with the save, an error box will appear.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="CmdSaveAs"><title>The "Save As.." Command</title>
<para>The "Save As..." command can be invoked 2 ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>By selecting <menuchoice> <guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>or by trying to "Save" a file which does not yet have a filename.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The difference between the "Save" and the "Save As..." command, is the "Save As..." command prompts you for a filename, and lets you select a different file format or location.</para>
<para>When you select the "Save As..." function, a dialog appears.</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="savedlg" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>Lets look at this dialog more closely:</para>
<para>This dialog shows my current directory is "/home/mmcbride".  You can see this by the textbox at the top of the dialog</para>
<para>The large box below that shows I currently have 13 folders in this directory.  One of the folders is "/home/mike/Desktop", another is "/home/mike/Mail".</para>
<para>In the upper left corner, is a blue arrow pointed up.  This arrow will take you up one level in the directory structure.</para>
<para>The next two buttons are backwards and forward buttons.  These buttons work just like a browser, where you can use the back button to travel to the previous directory, and the forward button to advance into a directory you just came from.</para>
<para>Next to the arrow buttons, is a button that looks like a house.  Clicking this will take you to your home directory.</para>
<para>Next to the home button, is a reload button.  Clicking this button, causes &kword; to reload the current directory in the event things have changed.</para>
<para>Next to the reload button, is a button with a purple ribbon on it.  This button allows you to set and navigate through bookmarks.  This is a quick way to jump to commonly accessed directories.  By clicking this button, a submenu appears which allows you to add bookmarks or jump to a new bookmark.</para>
<para>Next to the bookmark button, is a new folder button.  If you want to create a new folder, simply click the button.  &kword; will ask for a name for the folder.  Then the folder will be created and you will automatically be placed in the new folder.</para>
<note><para>There is one folder labled "..".  This is a special folder that exists in all directories on your computer.  It tells the computer that if I select this folder, to move up one level in the directory heirarchy. (If a directory heirarchy is a foriegn concept to you, I would recommend reading a chapter in a good Unix book, which describes the directory filesystem).</para></note>
<para>We can also see I have previously saved a file called "tempfile". (All KWord documents end in .kwd).</para>
<para>The text box labled "File Name" is blank, which indicates this file does not currently have a filename at all.  If you were saving a file to a new location (not saving a new file), you would see the current file name listed here.</para>
<para>The text box labled "File Type" shows we intend to save this as a KWord file.  Using KWord, you can save the file as other formats.  For information on this, see the section on <link linkend="Filters">Filters</link>.</para>
<para>There is a Cancel button, if you click this button, the save will be aborted, and you will return to editing the document.</para>
<para>There is an OK button, which will be used when we have selected the correct location, correct format and correct filename.  Clicking this button saves the file.</para>
<para>Using this dialog, you can move through the directory tree to find a location to save your document in.</para>
<para>To enter a folder, you double click on that folder.  To exit that folder, you double click the ".." folder, or the click blue up arrow  button.</para>
<para>When you are in the correct folder, you can type a name into the "File Name" box. There is no need to put a .kwd at the end of your filename, &kword; will do this for you.</para>
<note><para>Unix filenames are more flexible than many other operating systems.  Filenames can:</para>
<itemizedlist spacing=compact>
<listitem><para>be of nearly any length</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>be any comination of upper and lower case letters</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>include spaces and puncuation</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Filenames should not:</para><itemizedlist spacing=compact>
<listitem><para>begin with a space or period</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>end with a common file extension (.ps,.pdf,etc).  This will tell KWord to try to export to that filetype.  KWord has only certain specific <link linkend="Filters">filters</link>.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</note>
<para>Once you have entered the correct information you can click on "Save" to complete the save.</para>
<para>KWord does not report a sucessful save.  Therefore, if the file was saved without incident, KWord will return you to editing your document.  If there is a probelm with the save, an error box will appear.</para>
<note><para>KWord will only allow you to save your file where you are allowed to by the permisions listed by the operating system. If you try to save outside that area, KWord will generate an error.</para></note>

<para>The text box labled "File Type" shows we intend to save this as a KWord file.  Using KWord, you can save the file as other formats.  For information on this, see the section on <link linkend="Filters">Filters</link>.</para>
<para>When you are in the correct folder, you can type a name into the "File Name" box. There is no need to put a .kwd at the end of your filename, &kword; will do this for you.</para>
<para>The text box labled "File Type" shows we intend to load a KWord file.  Using KWord, you can load files from other formats.  For information on this, see the section on <link linkend="Filters">Filters</link>.</para>
<para>Another function of the "File Type" box, is to act as a file mask. A file mask hides all the files that KWord believes are unimportant to your current task.  When the KWord filetype is set to KWord file, the dialog box only shows Folders, and files ending in ".kwd".  If you file does not end in .kwd, you need to change the file type box to read "All files".  Now all files will be displayed.</para>

<para>You can also determine if the document is printed in forward order (print first page first), or reverse order (print last page first).</para>
<para>You can also set the number of copies.  You can either enter the number directly into the box, or use the arrows to adjust the number. KWord can print a maximum of 99 copies at once.</para>
<para>The left side of the print dialog, allows you to set the page size and the direction of print.  Any differences between the page formatted in the document view, and the page size and shape selected here, may result in truncated output. To prevent this, you should make these paper settings match your <link linkend="PageFormat">document settings</link>.</para>
<para>When you are satisfied with your selections, you can click OK to print.</para>
<para>If you click on Cancel, the printing will be aborted.</para>

<chapter id="Guides2"><title>Detailed Guides: Editing your Document</title>
<para>This section of the guide will cover more advanced features of data editing.  This section focuses entirely on text data.  For working with other types of data, please see the <link linkend="Guides3">next section</link>. </para>
<sect1 id="select"><title>Selecting Text</title>
<para>For many editing and formatting functions in KWord, you will want to perform a certain action (bold face, underline, etc) to a certain section of text, not the document as a whole. You specify which text you want by selecting (highlighting) text.</para>
<para>Selected text has a black background to seperate it from unselected text. You select text by designating a start and an end point.  All the ttext in between the start and end point is selected text.  (Note:  The "endpoint" can be located before the start point.  The text will not be reversed.)</para>
<para>You can select text with either the mouse or the keyboard. </para>
<sect2 id="selkb"><title>Using The Keyboard</title>

<sect2 id="selmouse"><title>Using The Mouse</title>
<para>To select text with the mouse, hold down the left mouse button and drag the cursor. This selects all text between the initial click of the mouse button and the current position of the mouse cursor.  When you release the mouse button, the start and endpoints will become fixed.</para>
</sect2></sect1>
<sect1 id="UndoRedo"><title>Undo/Redo</title>
<para>It happens all the time.  You are working on a document, and you make a change.  Then you realize, thats not what you wanted to do at all!</para>  
<para>Fortunately, &kword; has a solution for you.</para>
<para>Each time you make a change to a document, &kword; remembers what the change was.  If you decide to remove some of the changes, you can "Undo" each change one at a a time. </para>
<para>As an example, William Shakespeare is using &kword; to write his new drama.  He types in the following verse:   </para>
<informaltable frame=none><tgroup cols=2 align=left><tbody>
<row><entry>Chorus:</entry>

<entry>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</entry></row><row><entry></entry>
<entry>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</entry></row>
</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>
<para>Now he thinks to himself, <quote>Maybe Verona is not the ideal place?</quote></para>
<para>So he changes the line:</para>
<informaltable frame=none><tgroup cols=2 align=left><tbody>

<para><quote>No</quote>, he says to himself, <quote>that screws up the meter of the poem</quote>, and decides to change it back.</para>
<para>He selects <menuchoice> <guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Undo</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the menubar.</para> 
 
<para>The text now reads <quote>Verona</quote> again.</para>
<para>If, after you Undo a change, and then decide that was a mistake, you can select <menuchoice> <guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Redo</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and the Undo is reversed.</para>
<note><para>Sometimes it is not possible for &kword; to undo an edit.  You will be informed of this when you select the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> function, it will replace the Undo function with No Undo Possible.</para></note>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="Clipboard"><title>Cut/Copy/Paste and the Clipboard</title>
<para>The "clipboard" is a concept familiar to most people who have used modern word processors. It is a piece of your computers memory which is set aside as a temporary storage space.  You can "Cut" or "Copy" text from your document into the clipboard.  You can then move to another part of the document, and "Paste" this text back into the document at the new position.</para>
<para>The most common use for the clipboard is to move or coppy text which you have already entered into one part of your document to another part of the same document or to another document entirely.</para>
<para>This concept is probably best described with an example.</para>
<para>To do this, we will begin with a test sentence</para>

<para><quote>The big, red fox jumped over the lazy dog.</quote></para>
<para>Using the mouse or keyboard, you select the phrase <quote>big, red</quote>.</para>
<para>Now select <menuchoice> <guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the menubar or press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap></keycombo>.</para>
<para><emphasis>This has moved a copy of the selected text to the clipboard.</emphasis></para>
<para>You now place the mouse cursor between <quote>lazy</quote> and <quote>dog</quote> and click once.</para>
<para>Now select <menuchoice> <guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the menubar or press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>V</keycap></keycombo></para>
<para>The resulting sentence is: </para>
<para><quote>The fox jumped over the lazy big, red dog</quote></para>
<sect2 id="localcopy"><title>The Copy Command</title>
<para>The "Copy" command can be invoked 4 ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>By selecting <menuchoice> <guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>By clicking <inlinegraphic fileref="editcopy" format="png" align="center"></inlinegraphic> on the toolbar.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>You can use the keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap></keycombo></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>You can use the mouse to highlight the text.  That text is automatically moved into the clipboard.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The "Copy" command moves a copy of the selected text to the clipboard.  <emphasis>The original sentance is unaffected.</emphasis></para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="localcut"><title>The Cut Command</title>
<para>The "Cut" command can be invoked 3 ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>By selecting <menuchoice> <guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You can use the keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>X</keycap></keycombo></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The "Cut" command moves a copy of the selected text to the clipboard.  <emphasis>The selected text is then deleted from the sentance in your document.</emphasis></para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="localpaste"><title>The Paste Command</title>
<para>The "Paste" command can be invoked 3 ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>By selecting <menuchoice> <guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>By clicking <inlinegraphic fileref="editpaste" format="png" align="center"></inlinegraphic> on the toolbar.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>You can use the keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>V</keycap></keycombo></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The "Paste" command inserts a copy of all the text in the clipboard at the current position of the cursor.  The clipboard is unaffected. (So another paste command will produce yet another copy of the text in the document.)</para>
<note><para>If no text in the document is currently highlighted, the "Paste" command <emphasis>inserts</emphasis> the text at the current position of the cursor.</para>
<para>If there is selected text when the "Paste" command is executed, the selected text is <emphasis>replaced</emphasis> with the contents of the clipboard.</para></note>
<para>Remember:  You are not limited to the bounds of one document.  If you "Copy" (or "Cut") text from a document, you can "Paste" this text into another open document.</para>
</sect2></sect1>
<sect1 id="SearchReplace"><title>Finding and Replacing Text</title>
<sect2 id="lfind"><title>The Find Command</title>
<para>The "Find" command can be invoked 3 ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>By selecting <menuchoice> <guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Find and Replace...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>

<para>This first thing you need to do is enter what you want to search for in the text box labled Search String.</para>
<para>You can now click on either Find First or Find Next.</para>
<para>Clicking on Find First instructs KWord to begin at the beginning of the document and search for the first occurance of that string of characters.</para>
<para>Clicking on Find Next also instructs KWord to search for the string of letters, but KWord begins at the current cursor position.</para>
<para>When KWord finds a match, it moves the cursor to that point in the document, and highlights the matching string of characters.  You have the option of clicking Find Next again, to find the next match.  When you have found the string of letters you are looking for, you can click Close to close the window and return you to editing your document.</para>
<para>When KWord has shown you all the possible matches in the document, it will stop searching.</para>

<chapter id="Guides3"><title>Detailed Guides: Document Layout</title>
<para><link linkend="Guides">Two sections ago</link>, we talked about <link linkend="NewDoc">creating</link>, <link linkend="Saving">saving</link>, <link linkend="Loading">loading</link> and <link linkend="Printing">printing documents</link>. <link linkend="Guides2">The section after that</link> (the previous section), discussed <link linkend="Select">entering the textual information</link>, <link linkend="Clipboard">moving it around</link>, <link linkend="SpellCheck">spell checing</link>, and <link linkend="AutoCorrect">autocorrecting</link> your text.</para>
<para>This section of the guide is designed to help you layout your documents.  We will begin with changing the size and shape of the page and the margins, and work progressively trhough smaller and smaller blocks of text (frames, ethen paragraphs, then characters).</para>
<para>After we have discussed formatting individual characters, we will deal with some miscellaneous topics related to layout of your document.</para>
<sect1 id="PageFormat"><title>Formatting the Page</title>
<para>If you will remember back to when we talked about <link linkend="WPVSDTP">Wordprocessing Templates and DTP Templates</link>, we mentioned that there were differences in your formatting options.</para>
<para>Well these differences are most important when we talk about Formatting the Page.  What follows are two sections, one for formatting the page with a <link linkend="WPPageFormat">Wordprocessing Template</link>, and another section for formatting the page with a <link linkend="DTPPageFormat">DTP Template</link>. Each section is independent of each other, so you should refer to the section that applies to your document.</para>
<sect2 id="WPPageFormat"><title> Formatting the Page (Wordprocessing)</title>
<para>When you are working with a Wordprocessing Template, you control the size and shape of the main frame by setting the margins. </para>
<para>Formating the page is usually done by selecting: </para>
<para><menuchoice> <guimenu>Format</guimenu><guimenuitem>Page...</guimenuitem></menuchoice></para>
<para>From the menubar.</para>
<tip><para>You can also go straight to the "Format Page" options by double clicking on either of the rulers.</para></tip>
<para>A dialog box will appear with 3 tabs, labled "Format and Borders", "Columns" and "Header and Footer".</para>
<para>The "Format and Borders" tab is for altering the paper size, and changing the margins.</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="wpfmtpg1" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>First you will notice, that a preview box appears on the right half of this dialog.  This will <emphasis>approximate</emphasis> the final look of your document.  It is updated with each change, and should be used as a guide for your changes. </para>
<para>On the left, the dialog first informs you what unit of measurement it is using.  This unit of measurement is the same unit of measurement you have set for your rulers. (In this example, we are using inches.)</para>
<para>Below that, you can determine the paper format you will eventually print to.  Your choices are:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>DIN A3</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>DIN A4</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>DIN A5</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>DIN B5</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>US Exective</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Screen</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Custom</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>All of these options (with the exception of Screen and Custom), refers to standard paper sizes.</para>
<para>Screen is used to generate a document where each "page" has an <link linkend="defaspectratio">aspect ratio</link> (shape) which matches the aspect ratios of computer monitors.</para>
<para>If you select the "Custom" paper size, two text entry boxes (labled "Width" and "Height") become active.  Using these two boxes you can now enter any size paper you need.</para>
<para>Next to the paper format, you can select either <link linkend="defportrait">Portrait</link> or <link linkend="deflandscape">Landscape</link> layout for your document. (!!!!!!!!Does Landscape/Portrait mean anything with "Screen" or "custom"!!!!!!!!)</para>
<para>Below the page format options, is the Page Borders Options, which consists of 4 entry boxes labled ("Right", "Left", "Top" and "Bottom").</para>
<para>The Page Borders (aka Margins), define the whitespace surrounding the text in your main frame.  You can enter any number from 0 to the maximum size of the page in these boxes.

<para><emphasis>Headers</emphasis></para>
<para>This section lets you determine the placement of headers, and which pages have which headers on them.</para>
<para>In the text box labled "Spacing between header and body", you can specify how much empty space should be placed between the bottom of the header, and the top of the main frame.</para>

<listitem><para>Same header for all pages - If you select this option, all pages, even or odd, including the first page, will have the same headers. This is the default.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Different header for first page - If you select this option, the first page will use a different header than the other pages.  After the first page, all pages have use the same header</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Different header for even and odd pages - If you select this option, the even pages will use one header, the odd pages use another header.  You can use this to ensure the page numbers are always on the outside of the page, or to list the title of the document on odd pages and the chapter number on the even pages.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para><emphasis>Footers</emphasis></para>
<para>This section lets you determine the placement of footers, and which pages have which footers on them.</para>
<para>In the text box labled "Spacing between footer and body", you can specify how much empty space should be placed between the top of the footer, and the bottom of the main frame.</para>

<para>From the menubar.</para>
<tip><para>You can also go straight to the "Format Page" options by double clicking on either of the rulers.</para></tip>
<para>A dialog box will appear with 2 tabs, labled "Format and Borders" and "Header and Footer".</para>
<para>The "Format and Borders" tab is for altering the paper size.</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="dtpfmtpg1" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>First you will notice, that a preview box appears on the right half of this dialog.  This will <emphasis>approximate</emphasis> the final look of your document.  It is updated with each change, and should be used as a guide for your changes. </para>
<para>On the left, the dialog first informs you what unit of measurement it is using.  This unit of measurement is the same unit of measurement you have set for your rulers. (In this example, we are using inches.)</para>
<para>Below that, you can determine the paper format you will eventually print to.  Your choices are:</para>

<para>All of these options (with the exception of Screen and Custom), refers to standard paper sizes.</para>
<para>Screen is used to generate a document where each "page" has an <link linkend="defaspectratio">aspect ratio</link> (shape) which matches the aspect ratios of computer monitors.</para>
<para>If you select the "Custom" paper size, two text entry boxes (labled "Width" and "Height") become active.  Using these two boxes you can now enter any size paper you need.</para>
<para>Next to the paper format, you can select either <link linkend="defportrait">Portrait</link> or <link linkend="deflandscape">Landscape</link> layout for your document. (!!!!!!!!Does Landscape/Portrait mean anything with "Screen" or "custom"!!!!!!!!)</para>
<para>Below the page format options, is the Page Borders Options, which consists of 4 entry boxes labled ("Right", "Left", "Top" and "Bottom"). These boxes are inactive and cannot be changed.</para>

<sect1 id="Frames"><title>Working with Frames</title>
<para>Since KWord is a frames based wordprocessor, an understanding of Frames is necessary for all but the most simple of documents.</para>
<para>This section is designed to give you a firm understanding of how to create, destroy and manipulate frames so KWord can provide you with the exact document you want.</para>
<sect2 id="lFrameset"><title>Framesets</title>
<para>Before we continue our discussion of Frames, its important that we define a couple terms now:</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Frame</term><listitem><para>A frame is a rectangular space on the page.  This space defines an area where text (or other data), can be placed.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Frameset</term><listitem><para>A frameset is a group of frames.  Each frame in the framset has a position within the framset</para>
<para>The position is determined when the frames are created.  The first frame created is Frame #1, the second is Frame #2, etc.</para>
<para>All text flows from one frame to another <emphasis>within a frameset, and only within a frameset.</emphasis> Text flows from frame to frame within the frameset <emphasis>according to the position of each frame</emphasis></para>
<para>As an example:  If we have a frameset that consists of three frames (#1, #2, and #3).</para>
<para>As we type text into Frame #1, the text is shaped to the outline of Frame #1</para>
<para>When the text will no longer fit within Frame #1, it is automatically continued into Frame #2.</para>
</listitem></varlistentry></variablelist>
<para>As you can see, text must (and does) move freely between frames within a framset.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="lAddFrame"><title>Adding a Frame to a Document</title>
<para>Adding a frame can be done one of three ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>By selecting <menuchoice> <guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Create Text Frame</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>You can use the keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>F6</keycap></keycombo></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>or by clicking <inlinegraphic fileref="tfcreatebut" format="png" align="center"></inlinegraphic> on the toolbar.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Whatever method you choose, KWord responds by changing the cursor from to a set of crosshairs.</para>
<para>Using the mouse, place the cursor at one of the corners of your new text frame. (Any corner will work)</para>
<para>Now click and hold with the left mouse button.</para>
<para>Drag the mouse towards the opposite corner of the rectangle.  As you drag the mouse, you will see a box drawn.  This box represents the boundries of your new text frame.</para>
<para>When you are satisfied with the size and shape of your new text box, release the mouse button.  </para>
<para>A dialog box appears.</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="Tut15" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>The purpose of this dialog box is two fold:</para>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para>Determine which frameset this new frame will belong to</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Set up text flow options.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>The first tab ("Connect Text Frames") in this dialog box is used to determine which frameset this new text box belongs.</para>
<para>Using the example given, you have just created a new frame in a document which currently has two framesets (called Frameset 1, and Frameset 2).</para>
<para>You now have the option of either:</para>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para>appending this text box to one of the previously created framesets.</para>
<para>To do this, simply select the frameset you want to connect this new text box two (either "Frameset 1", or "Frameset 2")</para>
<para>When this text frame is created, the new text frame will become the last frame in the selected frameset.</para>
<para>or</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>You can create a new frameset.  This newly added frame will be the first (and currently only) frame in the frameset.</para>
<para>If you want this to be a new frameset, you can enter a descriptive name for your new frameset.  (A name which will tell you what you might find in that frameset).  This name should be entered in the text box labled "Name of new Frameset".</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>The other tab ("Text Frame"), can be used to set some options for this frame.  For more information on these options, see the section entitled <link linkend="FormatFrame">Formatting Frames</link>.</para>
<para>If you click "OK", the new frame will be created.</para>
<para>If you click "Cancel", the new frame will not be created, and you will be returned to editing your document.</para>
<note><para>KWord assumes you want to continue to add new text frames until you say otherwise.  </para>
<para>In other words, when you have created your new text frame, you must now tell KWord you want to <link linkend="lresizeframe">resize a frame</link>, or insert text into the frame, etc...</para>
<para>If you fail to change to another function, clicking with the mouse will create yet another text frame.</para></note>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="ldeleteframe"><title>Deleteing a Frame From a Document</title>
<para>You may decide you no longer need a frame in your document.  You could leave it blank (so it would not be visible in the final output), but you should probably delete it to keep your document as simple as possible.</para>
<para>By deleting a frame, you will also be deleteing from you document any data inside that frame.</para>
<para>In order to delete a frame, you must be in "Frame Edit Mode".  To change to Frame Edit Mode, you can:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Select <menuchoice> <guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit Frames</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>

<para>Once you are in frame edit mode, the cursor will change to an arrow.</para>
<para>Place the arrow inside the frame you want to delete, and click once with the left mouse button.</para>
<para>There is now 8 black squares on the edges of the frame.</para>
<para>If this is the frame you want to delete, you can do so by:</para>

</itemizedlist>
<para>If you are trying to delete the last frame in a frameset, KWord will ask you if you want to delete the current text frame.  If you click "Yes", the frame, all frames connected to it, and the data within these frames (if there is any), will be deleted. If you click "No", the frame will not be deleted.</para>
<para>If you are trying to delete a frame that is not the last frame in a frameset, KWord will not ask for a confirmation.  It will delete the current frame immediately, and move the data into the next frame in a frameset. No data will be deleted. </para>
<warning><para>Deleteing the last frame in a framset will delete the entire frameset.  All data within that frameset will be lost.  Always use caution when deleting the last frame in a frameset.</para></warning>

<para>If this is the frame you need to move, place the cursor inside the frame.</para>
<para>Move the cursor slightly in any direction.  The cursor will now change to four arrows arranged in a cross.</para>
<para>Hold the left mouse button down, and drag the cursor in the direction you want to move the frame.</para>

<sect2 id="lresizeframe"><title>Resizing an Existing Frame</title>
<para>If you want to resize a frame, you must be in Frame Edit Mode.  If you are not currently in frame edit mode, you can change to Frame Edit Mode, in one of three ways.:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Select <menuchoice> <guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit Frames</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>or by clicking <inlinegraphic fileref="framemode" format="png" align="center"></inlinegraphic> on the toolbar.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Once you are in frame edit mode, the cursor will change to an arrow.</para>
<para>Place the arrow inside the frame you want to move, and click once with the left mouse button. This selects this frame as the current frame.</para>
<para>There are now 8 black squares on the edges of the frame. By moving these squares, you will be able to drag the frame border(s) to a new location.</para>
<para>Each square will move a different combination of borders.</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="framers" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>As an example:  To move the bottom border of a frame, place the mouse over the box at the six oclock position in the frame.  When the mouse is over the box, it will change to a double headed arrow.</para>
<para>Now click with the left mouse button and hold the button down.  As you move the mouse up and down on the page, you will see that the frame changes shape to match your mouse movements. When you have the bottom edge of the frame where you want it, simply release the mouse button, and your changes will become permenant.</para>
<para>If you need to resize the frame of a neighboring frame, you should click once inside that frame (to make it the current frame), and you can move its borders in the same fashion.</para>
<note><para>If you are using a Wordprocessing Template, you cannot change the size of the primary frame by draging the edges of the frame.  If you want to resize this frame, you must do so by <link linkend="PageFormat">Changing the margins</link> </para></note>

<sect2 id="lhardbreak"><title>Hard Frame Breaks</title>
<para>A hard frame break is a special formatting character.  It is invisible on the final printed output.</para>
<para>The purpose of a hard frame break, is to force all the text that follows it into the next frame in the framset.</para>
<para>If we have the following sentance:  "We have nothing to fear but fear itself"</para>
<para>and we insert a Hard Frame Break, just before the word "but".</para>
<para>We will end up with one frame containing "We have nothing to fear", and the next frame in the frameset begins with "but fear itself".</para>
<para>To add a Hard Frame Break, you should first place the keyboard cursor where you want the break to be located in the document.</para>
<para>A Hard Frame Break can be inserted one of two ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Select <menuchoice> <guimenu>Insert</guimenu><guimenuitem>Hard Frame Break</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>You can use the keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Return</keycap></keycombo></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>If you want to remove a Hard Frame Break, you simply delete it like you would any other character.  Since this is not a character that you can see, I recommend the following procedure to most easily delete the Hard Frame Break.</para>
<para>First, I recommend turning on "View Formatting Characters" (Select <menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Formatting Characters</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar)</para>
<para>This will let you see the charage returns, and tab stops in your document.</para>
<para>Find the <emphasis>last</emphasis> carrage return <emphasis>before</emphasis> the break in your text.  Place the cursor in front of this carrage return.</para>

<listitem><para>or by clicking <inlinegraphic fileref="framemode" format="png" align="center"></inlinegraphic> on the toolbar.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Once you are in frame edit mode, the cursor will change to an arrow.  Place this arrow inside the frame you want to modify, and click once with the left button. You have now designated that frame as the "current" frame.</para>
<para>You can now edit the properties one of two ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Select <menuchoice> <guimenu>Format</guimenu><guimenuitem>Frame/Frameset</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu bar</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Place the cursor inside the "current frame", and click once with the right mouse button.  A small menu will appear.  Select "Properties".</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The Properties dialog consists of one dialog box, with three index tabs labled "Frameset", "Text Frame", and "Geometry".</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="formframe1" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>It is a common situation.  You define a frame, and begin to type.  There is too much text to fit within the current bounds of the frame.</para>
<para>KWord has two solutions to this problem.  Using this dialog, you can determine which method it uses.</para>
<para>If you choose "Create automatically a new frame", whenever a frameset becomes full, KWord automatically creates a new page. On this new page, it creates a new frame, of the same size and position.  It also sets the frame so that your text automatically flows into the new frame</para>
<para>If you choose "Resize automatically last frame", whenever a frameset becomes full, KWord automatically extends the bottom border of the text frame to accomidate the new text.  It will continue to expand as new text is added.</para>
<note><para>Remember this only applies to a full frameset.  If there is already another window for text to flow into, this will supersede any settings in this dialog box.</para></note>
<para>To adjust how text flows around overlapping frames, click the tab labled "Text Frame".</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="formframe2" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>When you overlay two text frames, and text from both frames is competing for the same space on the page, KWord can (at your option), make sure that text from two frames does not overlap. </para>
<para>As you can see from the options in the dialog box, there are three possible choices.</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>"Run through other frames"</term><listitem><para>By selecting this option, you are telling KWord to ignore all other frames when it displays the text in this frame.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>"Run around the Bounding Rectangle of other frames"</term><listitem><para>By selecting this option, you are telling KWord to wrap the text of this frame around other overlapping frames.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>"Don't run around other frames"</term><listitem><para>By selecting this option, you are telling KWord to not wrap any text around the edges of other frames, but instead, to skip down below the other frames before continuing to display text in this frame..</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<para>You can also determine how close your frames appear by setting the "Runaround Gap" in the textbox provided.  Increasing the size of the runaround gap will create a white border between the text in the two text frames. </para>
<tip><para>One common problem people have, when setting the text wrap features, is that they set both paragraphs to the same setting (Run around the bounding Rectangle of other frames).  When they do this, they end up with two paragraphs that look like this:</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="formframe4" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>As you can see, both Frame 1 and Frame 2 are wrapping around each other.  This leaves a blank space where the two frames overlap.  You can eliminate this space, and produce a cleaner look by changing either Frame 1 or Frame 2 to "Run through other frames". </para></tip>
<para>You can adjust the size, position and margins of your frame by clicking on the tab labled "Geometry"</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="formframe3" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>This dialog box allows you to specify <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> where the frame goes and how large it is.</para>
<para>You can locate your frame on the page by first entering the top and left measurements.  This determines where the top left corner of the frame will be.  All measurements are from the top left corner of the page.</para>
<para>You can also determine the exact size of the frame by entering its height and width in the text boxes provided.  These two measurements are relative to the top left corner of the frame you specified above.</para>
<para>You can also use this dialog box to specify margins for your frame.  The margins of the frame are similar to margins on a page. By entering a margin into the text boxes, you can have KWord automatically set aside a border of whitespace around the text in this frame.  This will ensure that the text will not be located too closely to other frames or margins.</para>
<tip><para>It is important to understand the difference between setting the margins here, and setting the "Runaround Gap" (see above).  </para>
<para>KWord only applies the Runaround Gap when two frames overlap.  If two frames are placed right next to each other, the runaround gap does not affect the final output.</para>
<para>When you set a margin for a frame, however, the whitspace is set aside reguardless of what other frames may be overlapping.</para></tip>

<sect1 id="Formatpara"><title>Formatting paragraph</title>
<para>This section will detail all the options available to format your paragraphs.</para>
<para>Before you start formating a paragraph, ensure your cursor is currently located in the paragraph you want to format.</para>
<para>The formatting paragraphs dialog consists of 5 tabbed sections labled "Indent and spacing", "Flows", "Borders", "Numbering", and "Tabulators"</para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="fpara1" format="png" align="center"></graphic></screenshot>
<para>This dialog box allows you to set the paragraph margins, the spacing between lines, and the spacing between paragraphs.</para>

<sect1 id="TabStops"><title>Using Tab Stops</title>
<para>Tab stops are a (very useful) holdover from the days of typewriters.  They allow you to align text into columns quickly and easily.</para>
<para>When a tab stop is in place, you can immediatly jump to that horizontal position on the page by pressing the "Tab" key.  Tab stops are most commonly used to allign columns in a table, or to automatically indent paragraphs.</para>
<para>Tab stops are part of the properties of a paragraph.  Each paragraph keeps track of its own set of tab stops.  You can view the tab stops of a particular paragraph by placing the mouse cursor within a paragraph, clicking once, and checking the top ruler.  The tab stops are marked as symbols in black. </para>
<para>KWord recognises 4 types of tab stops.  Each of these types has a corresponding symbol to help you identify the type in the ruler.  </para>

<chapter id="menuitems"><title>The Menu Items/Tool Bars</title>
<sect1 id="menuintro"><title>Introduction to Menu Bars and Tool Bars</title>
<para>The key to getting the most out of KWord, is found in the menu bars and the toolbars.</para>
<para>The menu bar is organized into groups of functions (ex file functions, table functions, etc...).  Below each of these groups, is a submenu of actions.  Some of these submenues will have sub menues of their own.  All of the functions of KWord can be found inside the menu bar hierarchy.</para>
<para>The tool bars are also organized into groups.  Each toolbar consists of a set of buttons.  Each button performs a specific function.  The toolbars are designed to act as shortcuts for more commonly used functions.</para>
<para>The first part of this section of the manual discusses the manipulation of Kword's toolbars to suit your needs.</para>
<para>The second part of this section, takes a detailed look at each menu bar function, and each tool bar button, and provides you with a brief summary of its action.  Most of these menu bar functions and tool bar buttons also provide you with a link to more detailed information.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="Toolbars"><title>Hiding, Changing, and Moving Tool Bars</title>
<para>KWord offers the user great flexibility when it comes to toolbars.  This first section will show you some of the many options you have for relocating, reformatting and removing toolbars from your desktop.</para>
<sect2 id="HideToolbar"><title>Hiding ("Flatening") Tool Bars </title>
<para>When you startup KWord, all the available toolbars are visible.  If you don't think you will need a toolbar, and want to reclaim that desktop space, 
you "minimize" the toolbar.</para>
<para>There are two ways to acomplish this task</para>

<listitem><para>Left</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Right</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Floating</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>Top, Bottom, Left and Right refer to the edges of the KWord screen.</para>
<para>By locating a tool bar in the "Bottom" position, for example, you move the toolbar into a horizontal position below the Document Area, and along the bottom of the Kword window. By locating a tool bar in the "Left" position,however, you move the toolbar into a verticle position to the left of the Document Area, and along the left edge of the Kword window.</para>
<para>Multiple toolbars can be located at each of these points in the screen.  (You could, for instance, move all the toolbars to the top of the screen).  KWord will shuffle toolbars around, to fit in the most compact way at that location.</para>
<para>If you move the toolbar into a "Floating" position, what you are doing is creating a new window just for that toolbar.  The toolbar continues to operate just as before, but you now have complete flexibility to place this toolbar anywhere on the screen.</para>
<para>There are two ways of moving your toolbars:</para>
<informaltable frame=none>

Option 1</entry></row><row><entry></entry></row><row><entry></entry><entry>
If you left-click on the stippled area of the toolbar (the same location you used to minimize the tool bar), and hold the button down, you can drag the toolbar around the KWord screen.  This allows you to move the
toolbars around to suit your needs.  You can also drag the toolbar off the KWord screen, and the toolbar becomes a "floating" toolbar.

<para>
This filter is in an early stage of development. Currently, the filter will 
do a reasonable job on simple text-centric documents and a very poor job 
where extensive formatting is used. The rest of this section describes what 
the filter currently can, and cannot do, in detail.</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem><para>
The filter can import documents written by various versions Word 97, and 
StarOffice documents saved in Word97 format. There is also limited Word 95 
compatibility.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The filter will translate full-saved documents. Fast-saved documents will 
be translated with no distinction made between old and current text - this 
can produce confusing results!</para>
<tip><para>To prevent this, open your document with Microsoft Word
and use "Save As..." to save it as a different file.  Immediatly close the document to prevent another "Fast Save".</para></tip>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>The filter will preserve headings and number them correctly.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The filter will preserve lists, including multi-level lists and numbered 
lists. If a list is split into multiple sections, numbering is currently 
restarted at each set of entries.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The filter will preserve tables. The filter cannot currently position 
tables correctly, but will insert text markers indicating where the table 
should be positioned. The tables are currently implemented as fixed frames; 
floating table frame support is under development.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>All other text is imported as body text.</para><note><para> Note: this includes the text of 
headers, footers and so on.</para></note></listitem>

<listitem><para>The formatting of text (e.g. bold face, italics, etc) is not currently 
preserved.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Embedded pictures, variables and document information are not converted 
at present.</para></listitem>
