<title>&kspread; Basics</title>

<note><para>Like the rest of KDE, &kspread; is highly configurable, which can
cause problems for readers trying to compare the text in a document such as
this with what they see on the version of &kspread; running on their desktop.
To cut down on some of the possibilities for confusion, it it suggested that
when you first start to use &kspread; you set the default options in all pages
of the &kspread; configuration dialog (obtained by selecting
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
Kspread...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>) except for <guilabel>Completion mode
</guilabel> in the <guisubmenu>Misc</guisubmenu> page, which should be set to 
<guimenuitem>None</guimenuitem>.
</para> 
<para>You may also find it helpful to enable Tooltips in the K menu
<menuchoice><guimenu>Preferences</guimenu><guisubmenu>Look &amp;
Feel</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Widget Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
dialog box. </para></note>

<sect1 id="starting">
<title>Spreadsheets for Beginners</title>

<para>This section attempts to explain by example what a spreadsheet program
such as &kspread; actually does, and why it is such a useful tool in any
situation where you have to deal with numbers. If you have already used a
spreadsheet program you may wish to skip to the next section.</para>

<para>The first thing to do is to start up &kspread;. You can do this by
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> clicking on a &kspread; icon if there is one
on your desktop or panel, or you can select
<menuchoice><guimenu>Office</guimenu><guimenuitem>&kspread;</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
from the K menu.</para>
<para>When it has started you will be given the choice of creating a new 
document from a template, opening an existing or recent document, or starting 
with an empty document. Choose <guilabel>Start with an empty document</guilabel>
.</para>

<para>Looking at &kspread; once it has started up, you will see a table of
empty rectangular cells arranged in numbered rows and lettered columns. This
is where you enter data or formulae, text or charts. 
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="starting1.png" format="PNG"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>Screenshot starting1</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</para>
<para>Now, enter the text and values shown in the first 5 rows of the above
screenshot into the same cells of your spreadsheet. Ignore what is in row 7
for the moment. To enter anything into a cell first select the cell by
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> clicking inside it, then type whatever you
want, then press <keycap>Enter</keycap> or use the arrow keys to move the
selection point to another cell.
</para>
<para>What we have entered so far could be a simple budget for the next two
months, listing how much we think we will be spending for Food, Shelter,
Clothing and any Other expenditure. Now select cell B7 (column B, row 7), 
type in <userinput>=B2+B3+B4+B5</userinput> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>. 
Because it begins with a <keycap>=</keycap> symbol &kspread; sees this as a 
formula, something it has to calculate, in this case by adding together the 
values in the 4 cells B2 to B5, and what is shown in the cell B7 is the result 
of that calculation.</para>
<para>You could enter a similar formula into cell C7, except that in this case
it would have to be <userinput>=C2+C3+C4+C5</userinput>, but there is an
easier way which is to Copy cell B7 and Paste it into C7. &kspread; will
automatically adjust the cell references from B.. to C.. when the Paste is
done.</para>
<para>At this point you may think that &kspread; is doing no more that you
could manage with pencil, paper and a calculator, and you could be right, but
remember that this is a very small example of a spreadsheet, doing simple
calculations on only a few numbers. For any reasonably sized table of values
using a spreadsheet to do the calculations is much quicker and more accurate 
than doing them manually.</para>
<para>Also, a spreadsheet lets you play the <quote>What if?</quote> game.
Because each formula is automatically recalculated whenever any of the values
it refers to are changed, you can quickly see what happens if you alter any of
them. Using our example you can see the effect of reducing the amount spent on
food in December by just entering a new value into cell C2. If you had a
spreadsheet that modelled the greenhouse effect accurately you could perhaps
see the effect of a 50 percent reduction in the amount of methane released 
into the atmosphere. </para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="selecting">
<title>Selecting Cells</title>
<para>You can select a single cell or a rectangular area of cells in the 
spreadsheet. The selected cell(s) are displayed with a thick black border
.</para>
<para>To select a single cell <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> click on it 
or enter the cell reference (for example <userinput>B5</userinput>) into the 
cell reference box at the left end of the Formula toolbar and press <keycap>
Enter</keycap>, or use the <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Goto Cell...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu option.</para>

<para>You can also steer your way around with the <keysym>arrow</keysym> keys. 
Pressing the <keysym>Enter</keysym> key will move the current selection one 
position up, down, left or right depending on the setting in the <guilabel>Misc
</guilabel> page of &kspread;'s <link linkend="configmisc">configuration 
dialog box</link>.</para>
<para>If you hold the &Ctrl; key down while using the <keysym>arrow</keysym> 
keys the selection will move to the start or end of the block of occupied 
cells.</para>
<para>To select an area of cells drag the mouse cursor across the wanted area 
with the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> button held down, or enter the 
references of the top left and bottom right cells separated by a colon into 
the Formula toolbar cell reference box (for example <userinput>B7:C14
</userinput>) and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>, or enter these cell references 
in a similar format into the dialog box brought up by <menuchoice><guimenu>
View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Goto Cell...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>
<para>You can also select an area of cells by selecting the cell in one 
corner of the wanted area then holding the &Shift; key down while using the 
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> mouse button to select the cell in the 
opposite corner.</para>

<para>To select a complete row or column of cells <mousebutton>left
</mousebutton> click on the row number at the left of the worksheet or on the 
column letters at the top. To select adjacent rows or columns drag the mouse 
pointer over the appropriate row numbers or column letters with the 
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> button held down.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="entering">
<title>Entering Data</title>
<para>Entering data into a cell can be as simple as selecting the cell, typing 
your data, then pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap> or moving the selection to 
another cell with one of the <keysym>arrow</keysym> keys. Depending on how you 
enter the data, &kspread; will interpret it as a number, date, time or text:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Numbers are entered in the obvious way; <userinput>123</userinput>, <userinput>
-123</userinput>, <userinput>456.7</userinput> or in scientific notation 
<userinput>-1.2E-5</userinput>.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Dates should be entered in your <quote>System</quote> format, as defined in 
the K menu <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu> <guisubmenu>
Personalisation</guisubmenu> <guimenuitem>Country &amp; Languages</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> dialog box.  If, for example, you are using the DD/MM/YYYY form 
you should enter <userinput>30/03/2002</userinput> for 30th. March 2002. 
Leading zeroes can be omitted from the day and month fields and only the last 
one or two digits of the year need to be entered if the date is in the current 
century, for example <userinput>9/1/2</userinput> for 9th January 2002. 
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Times should also be entered using the <quote>System</quote> format. For 
example if you are using a 12 hour clock then enter times in HH:MIN am|pm or 
HH:MIN:SS am|pm format such as <userinput>9:42 am</userinput> or <userinput>
10:30:52 pm</userinput>
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
&kspread; defines any input data as <quote>text</quote> if it can not 
recognize as being a number, date or time.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><para>By default, &kspread; right justifies numbers, dates and times 
within a cell and left justifies anything else. This can be a useful guide 
to whether you have entered a date or time in the correct format. But 
remember that how items are displayed can be changed by altering 
the <link linkend="formatdata">cell format</link>.</para></note>

<para>The main text entry box in the Formula toolbar provides an easy way of 
editing the contents of a selected cell. Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> or 
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> click on the green tick mark when you are 
happy with what you have entered, or click on the red cross to cancel your 
edits.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="copypaste">
<title>Copy, Cut and Paste</title>
<para>At first glance, &kspread;'s <guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem>, 
<guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> appear 
to be similar to these functions in other &kde; applications. Having selected 
a cell or cells, you can choose <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> or 
<guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu or from 
the drop down menu you get by holding the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> 
mouse button down on a selected cell, or just use the shortcuts 
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>C</keycap>
</keycombo> or <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>X</keycap>
</keycombo>, then you can move the selection to the target cell and choose 
<guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> or use the shortcut <keycombo action="simul">
&Ctrl;<keycap>V</keycap></keycombo>. However there are some 
subtleties associated with these functions in &kspread; and these are discussed 
below.</para>
<para>If a cell contains a formula then the formula itself is copied rather 
than the displayed result, and if the formula contains a reference to another 
cell, then that reference is changed by the <guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem> 
or <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> 
operation to point to the cell that is in the same relative position as in 
the original cell. For example if cell A2 contains the formula <userinput>
=B3</userinput> and is copied to C4, cell C4 will contain <userinput>=D5
</userinput>.</para>
<para>This may seem to be a rather strange way of doing a copy, but 
99 percent of the time it is exactly what is wanted (if it is not then see the 
section about <link linkend="absolute">absolute cell references</link>). 
For example in the simple shopping list shown below, cell D2 should contain 
<userinput>=B2 * C2</userinput>, D3 should be <userinput>=B3 * C3</userinput>, 
D4 should be <userinput>=B4 * C4</userinput> and so on. Instead of having to 
enter a different formula in each cell, you can just enter the first formula 
into D2 and then copy it into the cells below, letting &kspread; adjust the 
cell references to suit.</para>

</mediaobject>

<sect2 id="copypasteareas">
<title>Copying and Pasting Cell Areas</title>
<para>In the above example D2 can be copied into all three cells D3 to D5 at 
once by just copying D2 then selecting the complete cell area D3:D5 before 
doing the paste.</para>
<para>A rectangular area of cells can be cut or copied in one operation by 
selecting the area before doing the cut or copy. Then select the top left 
corner cell of the area you want to paste into before doing the paste.</para>
<para>If you cut or copy a rectangular area of cells, say B2:C3, and paste it 
into a larger area such as A10:D13 the original pattern of cells will be 
repeated to fill the target area.</para>
<para>&kspread; also provides a <quote>Drag and Copy</quote> method for 
copying cells down into other cells immediately below or to the 
right of the original cell(s). To use this method select the cell(s) to be 
copied then position the mouse pointer over the small black square at the 
bottom right corner of the selected cell(s) so the cursor changes to a double 
headed arrow. Then hold the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> mouse button down 
while you drag the selected cell(s) as far as you wish.</para>

<sect2 id="specialpaste">
<title>Other Paste Modes</title>
<para>A cell may contain text, a value, or a formula, and may also contain 
special font, border or background <link linkend="formatspread">formatting 
information</link>. &kspread; has special versions of Paste that let 
you handle these items in different ways.</para>

<para><guimenuitem>Special Paste...</guimenuitem> brings up the <guilabel>
Special Paste</guilabel> dialog box. By selecting the appropriate item from 
the top part of this dialog you can choose to paste just <guilabel>Text
</guilabel>, the cell <guilabel>Format</guilabel>, any <guilabel>Comment
</guilabel> in the cell(s) or <guilabel>Everything without border</guilabel>. 
The items in the bottom part of this dialog box allow you do do simple 
<link linkend="sumspecialpaste">arithmetic on an area of cells</link>.
</para>
<para><guimenuitem>Paste with Insertion...</guimenuitem> inserts the copied 
cell(s) into the sheet by moving the cells that would otherwise be overwritten 
a suitable number of rows of columns down or to the right. It can also be used 
to insert complete copied row(s) or column(s) into the worksheet.</para>
</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="insdel">
<title>Insert and Delete</title>
<para>Use the <keysym>Delete</keysym> key or <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit
</guimenu><guisubmenu>Clear</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Text</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> to remove the text, value or formula from selected cell(s), 
row(s) or column(s) without affecting anything else.</para>

<para>To delete everything in the selected cell(s), row(s) or column(s), 
including comments and special formatting, use <keycombo action="simul">
&Shift;<keysym>Delete</keysym></keycombo> or choose the <guimenuitem>Delete
</guimenuitem> option from the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu or from the pop 
up menu you get when you <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> click on a selection.
</para>
<para>To remove selected row(s) or column(s) completely, use the  
<guimenuitem>Delete Row(s)...</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Delete Column(s)...
</guimenuitem> options from the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> mouse button 
pop up menu.</para>
<para>If you select a cell or cells and choose <guimenuitem>Remove Cells...
</guimenuitem> from the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> mouse button pop up 
menu, you can then choose whether other cells in the worksheet will be moved 
up or to the left to fill in the space left by the cell(s) you have chosen to 
remove.</para>
<para>If you want to insert new, blank, row(s) or column(s) into the 
sheet, select row(s) or column(s) where you wish the new row(s) or 
column(s) to be placed and choose the <guimenuitem>Insert Row(s)...</guimenuitem>, 
<guimenuitem>Insert Column(s)...</guimenuitem> option from the <mousebutton>
right</mousebutton> mouse button pop up menu.</para>
<para>You can insert new cells into the worksheet by selecting the 
area where you want them to appear then choosing the <guimenuitem>
Insert Cells...</guimenuitem> option from the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> 
mouse button pop up menu. You will then be asked whether the existing cell(s) 
in the selected area should be moved down or to the right to make room for the 
new ones.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="simplesums">
<title>Simple Sums</title>
<para>If the first character in a cell is an equals sign (<keycap>=</keycap>) 
&kspread; will take the cell contents to be a formula which is to be  
calculated. The result of the calculation will be displayed in the cell rather 
than the formula itself. For example, enter <userinput>=2+3</userinput> 
into a cell and it should display <emphasis>5</emphasis>.</para>
<para>More usefully, a formula can contain references to other cells, so 
that <userinput>=B4+A3</userinput> will calculate the sum of the values in 
cells B4 and A3, and this calculation will be updated whenever cells B4 or A3 
are changed.</para>
<para>As well as addition, a formula can make use of the <keycap>-</keycap>
symbol for subtraction, <keycap>*</keycap> for multiplication, and <keycap>
/</keycap> to perform division. The round bracket symbols <keycap>(</keycap> 
and <keycap>)</keycap> can also be used as in normal algebra, so you could 
enter more complex formulae such as <userinput>=((B10 + C3) *5 - F11) / 2
</userinput>.</para>

<para>Cells containing a formula will be marked with a small blue triangle 
at the bottom left corner if the <guilabel>Show formula indicator</guilabel>
checkbox in the <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> page of &kspread;'s 
<link linkend="configdialog">configuration</link> dialog is checked.</para>
<para>&kspread; also includes a large number of built-in functions for 
applications such as statistical, trigonometrical and financial calculations. 
Their use will be examined in more depth in a <link linkend="formulas">
later section</link> of this manual, but if you are interested at this stage 
choose <guimenuitem>Function...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Insert
</guimenu> menu and take a look through the <guilabel>Function
</guilabel> dialog box that will be displayed..</para>
<para>For the time being, however, the <userinput>SUM</userinput> function may 
be of interest as it calculates the sum of all values in a specified area of 
cells. For example <userinput>=SUM(B4:C10)</userinput> calculates the sum of 
all values in the cell area B4 to C10.</para>
<para>If &kspread; displays a row of <keycap>#</keycap> symbols when you have 
entered your formula this usually means that it cannot understand what 
you have entered, but if the row of <keycap>#</keycap> symbols ends with a 
small red arrow this just means that the cell is not wide enough to display 
the complete result, in which case you should either make the cell(s) wider 
or change their <link linkend="formatdata">format</link> so that the result 
does fit properly.</para>

<sect2 id="recalc">
<title>Recalculation</title>
<para>If the <guilabel>Automatic recalculation</guilabel> box in the <guilabel>
Preferences</guilabel> page of the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guisubmenu>Configure KSpread...</guisubmenu></menuchoice> dialog box is 
checked, &kspread; will recalculate the values of cells whenever anything that 
affects them is changed.</para>
<para>You can instruct &kspread; to perform a recalculation at any time by 
using the <guimenuitem>Recalculate Sheet</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>
Recalculate Workbook</guimenuitem> options in the <guimenu>Tools</guimenu> 
menu or their shortcuts <keycombo action="simul">&Shift;<keysym>F9</keysym>

<sect1 id="sort">
<title>Sorting Data</title>
<para>In the simple example shown below, the data consists of the names and 
countries of a number of mountains together with their height above sea level. 
&kspread; can sort data such as this in different ways.</para>
<para>

<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="sort1.png" format="PNG"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>Screenshot of sorted data</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</para>
<para>We may want the data sorted so that the names are in 
alphabetical order. To do this select the area containing the data (A2:C7 
in this case) and choose <guimenuitem>Sort Increasing</guimenuitem> or 
<guimenuitem>Sort Decreasing</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Data</guimenu> 
menu.</para>
<para>Sorting is done alphanumerically, and is case sensitive, numbers coming 
before upper case letters which come before lower case letters, so that cells 
containing the entries <userinput>Cat</userinput>, <userinput>bar</userinput>, 
<userinput>77</userinput> and <userinput>Bat</userinput> would be sorted into 
the following order: <emphasis>77  Bat  Cat  bar</emphasis>.</para>
<para>The <guimenuitem>Sort Increasing</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Sort 
Decreasing</guimenuitem> options from the <guimenu>Data</guimenu> menu options 
sort the data according to the contents of the cells in the left column of the 
selected area. For more complex sorting select <menuchoice><guimenu>Data
</guimenu><guimenuitem>Sort...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to bring up the 
<guilabel>Sort</guilabel> dialog box.</para>
<para>Using the <guilabel>Sort criteria</guilabel> page of this dialog box you 
can choose which column of the data is to be used as a primary sort key and, 
if you wish, other columns to be used as secondary and tertiary keys. Using 
the example in the above screenshot, choosing column B as the first key and 
column C as the second would sort the data by country and, for each country, 
by height.</para>
<para>The <guilabel>Options</guilabel> page lets you sort by row instead of by 
column and allows you to sort using the order of items in a custom list such 
as January, February... instead of alphanumerically.</para>
<para>&kspread; can also place the results of a sort into a different area of 
the sheet, or even into a different worksheet, rather than overwriting the 
original data. To do this enter the 
top left cell reference of the target area into the <guilabel>Starting cell:
</guilabel> text box in the <guilabel>Options</guilabel> page. The cell 
formats will also be copied to the new area if you check the <guilabel>
Copy layout</guilabel> box. If you check the <guilabel>First row contains 
header</guilabel> box data in the first row will be copied directly to the 
first row of the target area without being included in the sort operation.

<para>You can also save a &kspread; workbook in a foreign format, see the 
<link linkend="importexport">Import Export</link> section for more information 
about doing this.</para>
<para>When you save a modified version of an existing workbook &kspread; 
will keep the previous version as a backup file, adding a <keysym>~</keysym> 
symbol to the end of the filename.</para>
<para>&kspread; can provide some protection against losing your work because 
of a computer crash or because you have closed &kspread; without saving the 
current workbook. It does this by automatically saving the latest version of 
the document you are working on every few minutes using a modified file name. 
The autosaved version is normally removed when you next save your workbook, 
so that it will only exist if it is more up to date than the version that was 
saved manually. 
When you open a workbook &kspread; checks to see if an autosaved 
version exists, and if it finds one will offer to open that instead.</para>
<para>Autosaved workbooks are saved with a file name of the form 
<filename>.yourfilename.autosave</filename>, note the leading period 
(<keysym>.</keysym>), so that <filename>spread1.ksp</filename> would be 
autosaved as <filename>.spread1.ksp.autosave</filename>. The autosave feature 
is <link linkend="configinterface">user configurable</link>.</para>

<sect2 id="templates">
<title>Templates</title>

then save it as a template by choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Create Template From Document...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. 
Doing this opens the <guilabel>Create Template</guilabel> dialog box. 
Enter a name for your new template into the <guilabel>Name:</guilabel> text

<para>The <guilabel>Create Template</guilabel> dialog box also lets you 
choose a different picture to be displayed above the template name in the 
<guilabel>Choose</guilabel> dialog box, and lets you save your templates 
under different group names, which will appear as different tab pages in

<chapter id="hardsums">
<title>Advanced &kspread;</title>
<sect1 id="series">
<title>Series</title>
<para>When constructing a spreadsheet you often need to include a series of 
values, such as 10, 11, 12..., in a row or column. There are several ways you 
can do this in &kspread;.</para>
<para>For a simple short series such as 5, 6, 7, 8... the <quote>Drag and Copy
</quote> method is the simplest. Enter the starting value into the starting 
cell and the next value of the series into an adjacent cell. 
Then select both cells and move the mouse pointer so that it is over the small 
square at the bottom right corner; the cursor will change to a 
diagonal double headed arrow. Then hold the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> 
mouse button down while you drag the cells down or across as needed.</para>
<para>The step size is calculated as the difference between the two starting 
values that you have entered. 
For example if you enter <userinput>4</userinput> into cell A1 and 
<userinput>3.5</userinput> into A2 then select both cells and Drag and Copy 
them down, the step size will be the value in A2 minus the value 
in A1, -0.5 in this case so you will get the series 4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2...</para>

<para>The <quote>Drag and Copy</quote> method will even cope with series where 
the step value is not a constant value but is itself a series. So that if you 
start with 1, 3, 4, 6 Drag and Copy will extend it to 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 
12..., the step value in this example being the series 2, 1, 2, 1...</para>

<para>&kspread; also recognizes some special <quote>series</quote> such as
the days of the week. Try entering <userinput>Friday</userinput> into a cell 
(note the capitalization) then Drag and Copy it down. To see what special series 
are available, and perhaps create your own, select <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools
</guimenu><guimenuitem>Custom Lists...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> .</para>

<para>If you select a cell and choose <guimenuitem>Series...</guimenuitem> 
from the <guimenu>Insert</guimenu> menu you will see the <guilabel>Series
</guilabel> dialog box. This is useful for creating series that are too long 
to be conveniently constructed using the Drag and Copy method, or for 
creating geometric series such as 1, 1.5, 2.25, 3.375... where the step value,
1.5 in this case, is used as a multiplier.</para>
<para>If the type of series that you want is too complicated for any of the 
previous methods, consider using a formula and Drag and Copying that. For 
example to create a series with the values 2, 4, 16, 256... enter 
<userinput>2</userinput> into A1, <userinput>=A1*A1</userinput> into A2, and 
Drag and Copy cell A2 down.</para>

<sect2 id="builtin">
<title>Built in Functions</title>
<para>&kspread; has a huge range of built in mathematical and other functions 
that can be used in a formula cell. They can be seen and accessed by selecting 
a cell then choosing <guimenuitem>Function...</guimenuitem> from the 
<guimenu>Insert</guimenu> menu. This brings up the <guilabel>Function
</guilabel> dialog box.</para>
<para>Select the expression you want to use from the listbox at the left of the 
dialog box then press the button with the down arrow key symbol on it to paste 
the expression into the text edit box at the bottom of the <guilabel>Math 
Expression</guilabel> dialog.</para>
<para>The <guilabel>Parameters</guilabel> tab page will then be displayed 
to let you enter the parameter(s) for the expression you have just 
chosen. If you want to enter an actual value for a parameter, just type it 
into the appropriate text box in the <guilabel>Parameters</guilabel> page. To
enter a cell reference rather than a value, <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> 
click on the appropriate text box in the <guilabel>Parameters</guilabel> page 
then <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> click on the target cell in 
the spreadsheet.</para>
<para>Instead of using the <guilabel>Parameters</guilabel> page, cell 
references such as <userinput>B6</userinput> can be entered by typing them 
directly into the edit box at the bottom of the <guilabel>Function</guilabel> 
dialog. If an expression has more then one parameter separate them with a 
semi-colon (<keysym>;</keysym>).</para>
<para>Pressing the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button will transfer the 
expression to the main &kspread; window's Formula toolbar edit box and close 
the <guilabel>Function</guilabel> dialog. Press the Formula toolbar 
button marked with a large green tick to put the expression into the selected 
cell.</para>
<para>You can of course do without the <guilabel>Function</guilabel> 
dialog and simply type the complete expression into the Formula toolbar's 
main edit box. Function names are not case sensitive. Do not forget that all 
expressions must start with an <keysym>=</keysym> symbol.</para>

<sect2 id="logical">
<title>Logical Comparisons</title>
<para>Logical functions such as IF(), AND(), OR() take parameters which have the 
logical (boolean) values True or False. This type of value can be produced by 
other logical functions such as ISEVEN() or by the comparison of values in 
spreadsheet cells using the comparison expressions given in the following 
table.</para>

<title>Arithmetic using Special Paste</title>
<para>Sometimes you may want to add a single value to a number of

single value. The <guimenuitem>Special Paste...</guimenuitem> option lets you 
do this quickly and easily.</para>
<para>First, enter the modifier value into any spare cell on your spreadsheet 
and <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> it. Then select the area of cells you want 
to change, choose <guimenuitem>Special Paste...</guimenuitem> from the

before selecting the target area and doing <guimenuitem>Special Paste...
</guimenuitem> . For example, if you enter <userinput>5</userinput> into cell

mark (<keysym>!</keysym>). For example if you enter <userinput>=Sheet2!A2
</userinput> into a cell in Sheet 1, that cell will take the value from A2 of 
Sheet2. Note that sheet names are case sensitive.</para>

<title>Splitting the View</title>
<para>If your spreadsheet is so large that you can not see all of it at once, 
splitting &kspread;'s window into two or more views can help you work on it. 
This is done by selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>
Split View</guimenuitem></menuchoice> which will split the current view into 
two parts. <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guisubmenu>Splitter Orientation
</guisubmenu></menuchoice> lets you choose between horizontal and vertical 
splitting.</para>
<para>This technique is particularly useful when you want select an area 
of the spreadsheet that is larger than can be shown in one view, perhaps to 
paste a copied cell into it. 
Use the scrollbars to position the two views to show the top left and 
bottom right cells of the wanted area, select the top left cell in one 
view then hold the &Shift; key pressed while you select the 
bottom right cell with the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> mouse button.</para>

where you can enter any name you wish.</para>
<para>You can also name a cell or area by selecting it then typing the name 
into the small text box at the left end of the Formula toolbar, overwriting the 
cell reference that normally appears here.</para>
<para>If you enter a name that has already been used into this text box 
&kspread;'s selection will change to show the named cell(s).</para>
<para>The <menuchoice><guimenu>Data</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show Area...
</guimenuitem></menuchoice> option will give you a list of existing names 
and let you change &kspread;'s focus to any of them or let you remove a name.
</para>
<para>Named cells are particularly useful in formulae as an alternative to 
<link linkend="absolute"> absolute cell references</link> as the names can 
be used in place of normal cell references and do not change when the 
cell containing the formula is copied. When a name is used in this way it 
should be enclosed in single quotation marks.</para>
<para>For example, if cell A1 has been given the name <userinput>fred
</userinput> then you can enter a formula such as <userinput>='fred' + 2
</userinput> into another cell which would always give the result of adding 
2 to the value in A1 no matter where the formula cell was copied to.</para>
<para>Note that cell and area names are treated as being in lower case.</para>
